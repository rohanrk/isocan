 * version blob is an SVG, the same move the mini-browser makes with
 * `text/uri-list` (see browseritem.ts). Everything the vocabulary already
 * promises comes free: undo is `item.delete`, redrawing is `item.addVersion`,
 * `isocan ls` lists it, `isocan get` downloads a real .svg, GC keeps the blob
 * alive, and a client that predates the Pen still renders the picture,
 * because a drawing is just an image.
 *
 * Ink is stored in WORLD coordinates: the SVG's viewBox is the drawing's
 * world bounding box and the item's x/y/width/height are that same box, so a
 * stroke sits on the canvas exactly where it was drawn, at any zoom.
 *
 * These helpers are the contract both clients share, so the CLI and the web
 * app can never disagree about what the blob means.

 * canvas, including the projection a live session is handed — can tell what
 * colour a drawing is. `itemColour` had a branch for strokes and no production
 * caller could ever reach it: "move the red one" was unresolvable because red
 * is not a paper and ink was never read.
 *
 * Writing the word at creation is the mechanism the voice research note asked
 * for. Every path that makes a drawing fills it: the Pen and `drawing_add`
 * from the strokes in hand, the CLI's add and merge by reading them back with
 * `inkFromSvg`. One field, read by the browser and the standing harness alike,
 * which is what stops them disagreeing about what "red" means.
 *
 * Two gaps remain and neither is pretended away. Drawings made BEFORE this
 * carry no word, because nothing rewrites old items. And **a picture's face**
 * — a photograph, a screenshot, a card — is pixels rather than paths, so it
 * needs a raster decoder this does not have and stays colourless.
 *
 * Unlike `paper` and `tint`, which are restricted to the five paper colours,
 * this holds any word in the spoken vocabulary: a pen draws in red, and red is
