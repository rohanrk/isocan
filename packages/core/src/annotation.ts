/**
 * An annotation: ink that is ABOUT something.
 *
 * The Pen already makes drawings. What makes one an annotation is that it
 * belongs to an item — the way an anchored comment belongs to one — so it can
 * be pointed at, acted on, and cleared when the thing it asked for is done.
 * Ink on bare canvas stays a drawing: nobody asked for anything, so there is
 * nothing to clear.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a new op or a new kind: an annotation is an ordinary
 * drawing item wearing two properties, so undo, versions, GC, `isocan ls`, and
 * every older client keep working without knowing the word.
