Agents, start here:
  \`isocan --agent-help\` is the collaboration protocol — naming yourself,
  appearing on the canvas, answering comments, parking on \`wait\` — with
  every verb on one line and a list of topics; \`--agent-help <topic>\` prints
  one. It ships inside this build, so it always describes the commands below.

The system:
  A local daemon owns the state; this CLI and the web app are equal clients.
  Every command here sends the same operation the web app would, so changes
  appear live in any open browser — and vice versa.

  canvas    a canvas; list with \`isocan canvas ls\`
  item       a file rendered on the canvas (markdown, image, video, HTML) at
             x,y world coordinates (+x right, +y down)
  browser    \`isocan browse <url>\` projects a live site onto the canvas —
             point it at the localhost dev server you're building and the
             human watches it run (vite HMR keeps it fresh by itself)
  version    every \`edit\` stacks a new version on the item; \`version promote\`
             brings any older one back to the top; \`version prune --keep N\`
             bounds a stack that a generator keeps growing (not undoable)
  comment    threads pinned to an item (--item) or a spot (--at x,y); write
             @Name to address someone, \`comment anchor\` to re-pin a thread.
             One thread may be \`comment main\`: the canvas's Chat, as the
             web app calls it — docked rather than pinned, and \`wait\` always
             wakes on comments landing there
  undo       per-actor: \`isocan undo\` reverts YOUR last change, never a
             collaborator's
  trash      deleted items are recoverable until \`trash empty --force\`

Conventions:
  <item> and <thread> arguments accept an id, an id prefix, or a title prefix.
  A directory is bound to its canvas by <dir>/.isocan/project.json — written
  automatically when an agent names itself here (\`identity --session\`), or
  by hand with \`isocan use <canvas>\`. Commands run anywhere under it
  resolve there (nearest marker wins, like .git); the marker is meant to be
  committed, so a clone knows which canvas it is. --canvas overrides per
  command; \`isocan use <ref> --home\` sets a fallback for unbound dirs.
  Identity stamps every change you make. A person: \`isocan identity --name
  "You" --home\`. An agent: \`isocan identity --session\` — the daemon hands
  out a free name, or asks for yours with --name. Auto-starts when needed.

Your name (agents, read this):
  You need a name of your own — not your model's or vendor's, and never the
  human's. \`isocan identity --session\` hands you a free one (Isaac, Kenny,
  Nico… — names hiding in the letters of "isocan"); ask for a specific one
  with --name and the daemon refuses it if somebody already answers to it,
  since \`@Name\` addresses people by name. Keep it for the whole
  collaboration so the human can call you back by it.

Presence (automatic once you have a session):
  isocan session start --label "You"    appear as a live cursor on the canvas
  From then on presence follows the work by itself: every operation moves
  your cursor to where it happened, reads narrate themselves ("looking at…",
  "reading the comments…"), waking from \`wait\` lands your cursor on the
  summoning thread, and posting a comment clears your status — done is done.
  isocan session work <item> --say "…"  say it in your own words — your words
                                        outrank the derived narration until
                                        your next comment
  isocan who                            see everyone on the canvas right now
  isocan who --all                      every name the canvas knows, live or not

A typical collaboration loop:
  session start → comment list → session work <item> --say "…" → build →
  edit/add/mv/… → comment reply <thread> "…" → \`isocan wait\` (blocks until
  the next comment that's for you — @-mentions you, lands in the main
  thread, or is in your thread — on this directory's canvas) → repeat.
  The loop's only exit is the human saying so: \`session end\` is theirs to
  ask for, not yours to decide. Every other lap ends parked on \`wait\`.`,

 * **`isocan mcp` — the canvas, for an agent isocan did not install** (#220,

 *
 * An agent manager launches an MCP server by spawning a command and speaking
 * JSON-RPC over its pipes, so the surface needs a command to be. This is it,
 * and it is deliberately one line of work: everything the tools do lives in
 * `@isocan/mcp`, where a test can drive it without a subprocess.
 *
 * **Plumbing, not a canvas verb.** Nobody types this — it goes in a manager's
 * config (`"command": "isocan", "args": ["mcp"]`) and is spawned from there.
 * An agent that HAS this CLI on its PATH should use the CLI; this exists for
 * the agent that does not, which by construction is never the agent reading
 * the guide.
 *
 * **stdout belongs to the protocol.** `--json` and the printers are not
 * reachable from here, and nothing in this action may print: a stray line
 * lands inside a JSON-RPC frame and the host disconnects with a parse error a
 * long way from its cause. The banner an interactive command would show goes
 * to stderr in `serveStdio`, or nowhere.

/**
 * **Where a canvas born here is born, and where each canvas already here
 * lives** — phase 7.5's verb, re-scoped by phase 10.3.
 *
 * `config.json` has had a `home` key since phase 6 and `resolveHomeUrl` has
 * always read it; nothing could ever WRITE it, so the only ways to reach it
 * were an environment variable and a text editor. That is a missing verb, not
 * a missing feature, and it is not only a developer's problem: commitment 2
 * says `isocan serve` on a rented VM is a complete home, so anybody pointing
 * their daemon at their own innkeeper's home walks straight into it.
 *
 * **What it sets narrowed, and the narrowing is the point.** It used to demote
 * a whole daemon: every canvas on the machine started being written somewhere
 * else. Now the home is a property of the CANVAS — the marker has said so
 * since Scene 0 — and this key is the **birth default**, consulted when a
 * canvas is minted and never again. So `isocan home <url>` moves nothing that
 * already exists, `--clear` un-moves nothing either, and phase 14's flip of a
 * shipped default address cannot re-point anybody's work. The key was
 * re-purposed rather than renamed on purpose: an upgraded daemon reading an
 * old `config.json` finds `home` set, births new canvases there, and — with
 * the boot migration freezing everything already held at that address — behaves
 * on upgrade day exactly as it did the day before.
 *
 * **This is not phase 6 being undone, and it is not phase 7.5 being undone
 * either.** Phase 6 refused a `--home` FLAG on `isocan serve`, on the same
 * grounds as `ISOCAN_BIND` and `ISOCAN_STORE`: where canvases go is innkeeper
 * configuration, not a per-invocation choice an agent reaches for. Phase 10.3
 * is exactly where somebody would reintroduce it — "just let this one command
 * name a home" — and the answer is still no. What travels beside a birth is
 * not a flag; it is the marker's assertion, committed configuration read out
 * of `.isocan/project.json`.
 *
 * **No compiled-in default, still.** `isocan home` with no address SHOWS;
 * there is no address baked in for it to fall back to, because a CLI
 * shipping with `isocan.io` as its default would turn `isocan serve` in this
 * checkout into a replica of production. The flip belongs with phase 14's
 * promotion gesture, where it is one line.
 *
 * **It keeps its restart** (phase 10.3's ruling 5). Correctness no longer
 * demands one — a live `PUT /api/homes/birth` is filed as a follow-up — but
 * `pointDaemonAtHome`'s read-back verification is this repo's own standing
 * lesson embodied: a step that cannot read back the state it wanted has
 * verified nothing.

 * - a no-op does not bounce the daemon — anything parked on `isocan wait`
 *   loses its socket to a restart, and setting the birth default to what it
 *   already is should cost nobody their connection.
 * - the daemon reads this once, at boot, so the restart is what makes the
 *   write true, and the health route afterwards is what proves it did. Phase
 *   10.3's ruling 5 kept that restart deliberately: correctness no longer

 * slot that belongs to the human, and an agent-only machine (no person in that
 * file at all) mints the admission-only shape instead — which is still worth
 * having, because admission is the half that survives the link being switched
 * off.
 *
 * **Nothing here may break `open`.** Opening the canvas is the job; the pass
 * is an improvement on it. A home that cannot be reached, a claim the badge
 * cannot prove, a daemon too old to have the route — every one of them lands
 * on the plain address, which is exactly what this verb printed for its whole

/**
 * **Share** — the verb half of the Share dialog, and the first gesture in this
 * CLI that is not a canvas op.
 *
 * That is worth stating rather than discovering. Every other verb here turns
 * into an `Operation` applied by the one reducer; this one acts on the OUTSIDE
 * world — grants, addresses, who may knock — so its parity with the button
 * lives at the daemon API instead (the journey's rule 5: "pretending it is an
 * op would make the oplog lie"). Button and verb drive exactly the same three
 * routes, and neither of them spells a URL: `@isocan/core` does.
 *
 Five shapes, one endpoint:
 *
 * - `isocan share` — the address to send, whether the link is on, and who has
 *   been invited by name.
 * - `isocan share --link off` / `--link on` — revoke, or grant again.
 * - `isocan share --link view` — the link admits to LOOKING (#88): viewers
 *   land on the deck full screen and every write is refused by the home. The
 *   people already in on the link are re-rooted to view, not expelled.
 * - `isocan share <email>` — **phase 9 stage 2's slot, filled.** The home
 *   writes the row, and whoever proves that address is admitted whether or not
 *   the link is on. On a home that has borrowed no attester the request is
 *   still sent and the home's own `no-attester` explains why it cannot: a
 *   client-side "not yet" would be a second copy of a policy that varies by
 *   which home the canvas lives at — and on a machine with two homes, by which
 *   canvas you are standing in.
 * - `isocan share --revoke <email>` — un-invite, which EXPELS them unless a
 *   surviving grant still covers them. It takes the sentence, not the row id:
 *   a person who wants somebody out knows their address. When the link would
 *   still admit them the verb says so — *they can still enter by the link;
 *   `--bar` to keep them out* — because withdrawing an invitation and barring
 *   a person are different acts (roles journey 3, step 3).
 * - `isocan share --revoke <email> --bar` — both in one request: the row is
 *   revoked and a BAR is written, a row that says no whatever the link or any
 *   other row says, until an owner lifts it. `--bar <email>` writes one
 *   directly; `--unbar <email>` lifts it. The table prints a bar as **kept
 *   out**, with who wrote it and when.
 *
 * **An agent can do all four, and that is deliberate.** Signing in is a
 * person's gesture — an agent has no inbox and no browser — but *inviting
 * somebody by name* is ordinary collaboration work, and an agent that could
 * only hand out the link would be handing out more access than it was asked
 * to. Seeing what a badge has proved is `isocan badges`.
 *
 * **The rung is a ladder** (roles design): `--link` takes `edit`, `read` or
 * `view`, and `--as` puts an invitation on a rung, `own` included. Every
 * change to who may enter — inviting, revoking, the link — is an owner's
 * (roles phase 2): the creator, or anybody granted `own`. The home refuses
 * everyone else with `not-owner` and names the owner. The table's first line
 * is the creator's, **owner, made this**, because that standing is not a row.
 *
 * On a replica every one of these forwards to the home, because the row that
 * decides who may enter lives there. Nothing here has to know that — but it is
 * why `isocan share --link off` run on a laptop really does turn the link off
 * for the world, rather than editing a local copy and reporting success.

 * would enroll her own second machine."* Isomorphism is a house rule here, not
 * a courtesy, and this is the verb half of the button stage 3 builds. Neither
 * surface spells the command: `setupCommand` in `@isocan/core` does, so the
 * string the dialog shows and the string this prints agree by construction
 * rather than by two people remembering the same thing.
 *
 * **It is named after the thing it makes.** Every other name considered read
 * as the wrong gesture: `isocan enroll` and `isocan escalate` are imperatives
 * about a machine, and the machine they name is the one being enrolled — which
 * is the machine running `setup`, not this one. `isocan invite` is `isocan
 * share`, which already exists and is a different act. "Pass" is the word the
 * design, the journey, the refusal codes and the desk all already use.
 *
 * **What it prints is the whole command, never a bare token**, for one reason:
 * a person holding a bare token has to be told what to do with it, and being
 * told what to do with a credential is how credentials end up in the wrong
 * place. A line that begins `npx` is a line you paste into a terminal.
 *
 * **Share versus pass — the distinction to keep straight.** `isocan share`
 * hands a PERSON an address; they arrive thin, in a browser, and the door
 * decides. `isocan pass` hands a MACHINE a credential; it arrives thick,
 * admitted whatever the link grant says, and — by default — being you. The
 * first is an invitation and the second is a key, so the second is
 * short-lived, single-use, and not something to post anywhere.

 * cross-site frame is a stranger. It cannot ride the badge cookie this
 * machine's browser holds, because that cookie lives in a jar keyed on the
 * TOP-LEVEL site and the top-level site is the manager's, not ours. So the
 * pane needs to be handed an identity on its first load, and a pass is
 * exactly the credential for that: short-lived, single-use, and endowing.
 *
 * **Three verbs, three acts, and the difference is who arrives.** `share`
 * hands a PERSON an address and the door decides. `pass` hands a MACHINE a
 * credential and prints a terminal line, because a machine is enrolled by
 * somebody typing. `embed` hands a WINDOW a URL, because a window is not
 * enrolled at all — it is opened, once, by being pasted into a pane. Same
 * credential underneath `pass`, different thing to do with it, and the output
 * differs accordingly: a URL, not a command, because a `npx` line pasted into
 * an address bar does nothing and a URL pasted into a terminal does worse.
 *
 * **It works once, and after that the pane keeps itself.** The redemption
 * mints a badge in the frame's own partitioned jar (`badgeCookie`), so a
 * reload is free and the pane's badge is isolated from this browser's — which
 * is the right posture for a credential handed to a window somebody else
 * owns. The exception is a local daemon over plain HTTP, where `Partitioned`
 * cannot be set at all: there the pane is admitted for the session it was
 * given and a reload starts over. That is the limit `badgeCookie` records,
 * and it is why this prints the expiry rather than pretending it is a

/**
 * **`isocan badges` — your own surfaces, and ending one.**
 *
 * The verb half of kill-a-badge (identity desk, mechanism 1), and the agent's
 * hands for the gesture the design describes as *"the stolen-laptop case"*.
 * It is here rather than only in a browser for the reason every verb in this
 * file is here: a canvas for people AND agents, and an agent that cannot see
 * which machines carry its identity cannot end one.
 *
 * **A surface is a badge that shares an identity with yours** — a badge
 * holding a claim on an actor your badge also claims. That is the whole rule,
 * and it is what makes the listing small and the gesture safe: a stranger has
 * no claim in common with you, so nobody can use this to expel anybody.
 *
 * **It asks the HOME**, and that is the point rather than a detail. A laptop
 * holds two badges — one at its own daemon, one at the home — and the local
 * one is not a boundary against somebody sitting at that keyboard. What
 * actually stops a stolen machine is that its badge AT THE HOME is ended: its
 * ops are refused and replication goes stale. So this verb shows the home's
 * list, and `--kill` ends a badge there.
 *
 * **Which home, on a machine with several?** A badge is not about one canvas,
 * so there is no canvas to read the answer off, and phase 10.3 left that as a
 * named seam rather than a solved problem: the daemon asks the birth default
 * when there is one, else the single home it dials, else nothing
 * (`HomeLinks.homeScoped`). On the two rigs anybody has — a pure home and a
 * machine with one home — that is exactly what it always did. On a mixed rig
 * it means this verb reports one home's surfaces and not the other's, which
 * is a narrow answer rather than a wrong one, and the fix when a scene forces
 * it is for the question to name its home.
 *
 * `--kill` rather than a second command, following `share --link off`: the
 * destructive act names its target explicitly, so no invocation of the bare
 * verb can ever end anything. And killing your OWN row is allowed and warned
 * about — signing this surface out is a real thing to want, and doing it by
 * accident is not.

 * argument that is *sometimes* a path and *sometimes* a URL is the kind of

 * written down here rather than inferred at the call site, and it is decided
 * by the SHAPE of the string — never by what happens to exist on disk. A

 * different things on two machines.
 *
 * In order, and the order is the whole rule:
 *
 * 1. **Anything that starts like a path is a path.** `.`, `..`, `/`, `~`, and
 *    a Windows drive letter. This is first so that a directory can always be
 *    named unambiguously — `setup ./whatever` is a directory even if somebody
 *    creates one called `isocan.io`.
 * 2. **Anything `parseCanvasAddress` accepts is an address**, pass and all.
 *    That is the same parser `@isocan/core` uses to spell the address in the
 *    first place, so "what setup accepts" and "what the dialog produces"
 *    cannot drift.
 * 3. **Anything that is trying to be an address is refused as one.** A scheme,
 *    or a first segment shaped like a hostname (a dot or a port, or
 *    `localhost`), means the person pasted an address — and a near-miss must
 *    say so, not go looking for a directory named `isocan.io/7f3a`. Phase 7's
 *    finding is that this system's default answer to a wrong address is a
 *    cheerful one; this is the same class of mistake at the one gesture where
 *    the person typing is a stranger who was thin thirty seconds ago.
 * 4. **Everything else is a directory**, exactly as before.

 * screens. That is the same failure the size gate had before it was split —

 * system governs. A note, a picture and a drawing are not designs to be
 * consistent with, and refusing them would make this a gate about uploading

 *

/**
 * **Do the bytes agree with the ops?**

 * leaves a teammate holding the item, its title and its version, with "blob
 * not found" where the screen should be, and it never heals, because nothing
 * ever looks.
 *
 * It was reported that way and could not be answered from either machine:
 * a local read is served from the local copy, so the one question that
 * mattered — are the bytes AT THE HOME — had no way to be asked. The fix was
 * a hand re-upload and the confirmation was somebody else's reload, which is
 * a guess that happened to work.

/**
 * **Copy items — the durable act behind the app's ⌘C/⌘V.**
 *
 * The clipboard is a UI idea and stays one: it is local, it is per-tab, and
 * nothing about it belongs on the wire. What both surfaces share is what
 * actually happens when you paste — new items, made from the old ones,
 * arranged the way they were. So the CLI has the ACT, not the clipboard, and
 * the two produce the same ops.
 *
 * Across canvases the bytes have to travel: a blob is addressed per canvas,
 * so a copy into another canvas re-uploads it there. Content addressing makes
 * that cheap to be right about — the same bytes hash the same on both sides,
 * so a canvas that already holds them gains nothing new.

/**
 * **Say something in the Chat, in one command.**
 *
 * The Chat is the canvas's own conversation and the channel every parked
 * agent hears — `wait` wakes on anything landing there with no @-mention —
 * and it is also, in the app, the thing that raises a toast on somebody's
 * screen. So "notify the human" and "post to the Chat" are the same act, and
 * this is that act with the ceremony removed.
 *
 * The ceremony was the problem. Posting to the Chat meant knowing the main
 * thread's id: `comment main` to find it, then `comment reply <thr>` to
 * speak. `comment reply main` does not resolve. So an agent with something to
 * announce reached for `comment add`, which is a PIN — a thing stuck to a
 * spot on the canvas — and a canvas collected pins for announcements that
 * were never about anywhere in particular.
 *
 * On a canvas with no Chat yet, the first message births it, exactly as the
 * app's own `postToMain` does. Its coordinates are only where the pin would
 * land if the channel were ever demoted, and this end has no viewport to
 * offer, so they are the origin and say so.

The wait is on ONE canvas — this directory's (#60), or the one --canvas or
--since names. An agent belongs to the canvas of the directory it works in,
and that canvas is where the human reaches it.

A comment wakes you when it @-mentions you (identity name or session label),
lands in a MAIN thread (\`comment main\`), or lands in a thread you wrote
in or were mentioned in. Everything else — including comments that mention
nobody — is ether: visible in \`tail\`, but not actionable. --all-ops wakes
on everything.

--item, --op and --in narrow which CHANGES wake you, so a watcher does not
spend a turn deciding it does not care:

  isocan wait --item itm_abc --op item.addVersion --json --timeout 900
  isocan wait --in "Sketches" --op "thread.*" --json --timeout 900

A summons still wakes you through any filter. Being told to stop is not noise,
and an agent you cannot reach is worse than one that wakes too often — the
JSON says which it was (\`reason\`: "summons" or "change").

Run this in the FOREGROUND, as one tool call: the call returning is your
wake-up. Detached (\`nohup\`, \`&\`, output redirected to a file you poll) it
still holds your cursor but cannot wake you — a file is not a notification.
Size --timeout to the longest call your harness allows. Exit 2 is silence,
not dismissal: park again. A wait that expires never means the collaboration
is over — only the human saying so does.

Your place in the log outlives the process: the daemon keeps a cursor per
actor per canvas, so a park that is killed — mid-gap, mid-turn, however —
resumes exactly where it left off when you park again. Nothing lands in a
gap unseen, and --since is a repair tool, not something to remember. An
entry handed to a turn that died before finishing comes back flagged
\`redelivered\` — you may already have answered it; check the thread before
answering twice. One park per actor per canvas: parking again adopts the
cursor, and the older park exits 3 ("another park adopted this actor's
cursor") — that exit means stand down, not park again.

While parked, the cursor you left on the canvas says "waiting for you…";
waking on a summons then moves your presence for you: your cursor lands on
the thread that woke you, showing "reading your comment…" until your next
command or reply. No \`session start\` needed after a wake.`,

    `
Bare \`isocan rc\` takes no arguments: the directory's binding supplies the
canvas, the enrolment records supply the roster. Starting it spawns nothing
— it enables. It narrates events as they happen (an enrolment, a
withdrawal, a summons); the roster is read where rosters are read,
\`isocan who\`. Ctrl-C stops answering for everyone; the enrolments survive
to its next start.

An agent enrolled without a harness named runs on this machine's default:
the only harness installed here, or the one \`--default-harness <name>\` picked
(kept in ~/.isocan/config.json as defaultHarness). With two installed and
none picked, a terminal start asks; a start with no terminal refuses and
names the flag. \`isocan harness\` prints what is installed and runnable.

A summoned agent's environment is a list, not your shell: what a process
needs (PATH, HOME, locale, proxies), isocan's own variables, and each
vendor's namespace (ANTHROPIC_*, CLAUDE_*, OPENAI_*, CODEX_*, GEMINI_*, PI_*).
Anything else you export stays behind. A harness that needs more is named
once in ~/.isocan/config.json: {"adapterEnv": ["MY_VAR", "MY_PREFIX_*"]}.
Permission prompts are answered for the one call only; an option that
would outlast the turn (a standing rule, a mode switch) is refused and said.

Whose word starts a turn is yours to say, because the turn spends your
tokens here: an agent answers only you (and anything this machine speaks
as) until you widen it — \`isocan rc listen <name> --to <names|everyone>\`.
Somebody else's mention is answered in its thread by isocan, naming you and
that command; nothing starts and nothing counts against the ceiling. The rc
tells the canvas whose word each agent takes, so the tray and \`isocan who\`
can say it before anybody asks.

--sandbox goes further and fences the adapter from outside the harness, so
the limit holds whatever the harness does: it writes only its own directory,
~/.isocan and /tmp, reads nothing else of your home, and reaches only this
daemon and its harness's API. It needs srt on the PATH (npm i -g
@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime) and, on Linux, bubblewrap and socat; asking
for a fence this machine cannot build is refused rather than run open.
{"sandbox": true} in ~/.isocan/config.json is the standing answer, and
--unsandboxed overrides it. sandboxDomains, sandboxRead and sandboxWrite
there add what the derived policy cannot know. \`isocan harness\` says
whether this machine could fence at all.

An agent never starts an rc — inside a harness session this refuses, and
the agent's spelling of the verbs is \`isocan agent\`.`,

 *
 * The gate lives in canvas state, on the enrolment, because a person who
 * mentions an agent that will not answer them must be able to SEE why —
 * the design's first failure mode is a silent gate, and a machine-local
 * setting is silent by construction. But a gate is a fact about the AGENT,
 * not about a room, so a person must never have to type it twenty times:
 * this verb writes the same gate to every canvas the agent stands on, and
 * `--canvas` narrows it to one when that is really what was meant.
 *
 * What it is NOT: the sheepdog's on/off switch. That one is flipped from a
 * phone, in a hurry, and N ops with a failure in the middle would leave a
 * pet half asleep — which is exactly why the design puts it in a kennel
 * record at the home rather than on the enrolments. `listen` changes
 * rarely and reads on every surface, so the enrolment is the right home
 * for it and the wrong home for the switch.

 * With nothing written, an agent answers only the person whose rc runs it;
 * `--to` adds people, `--to everyone` makes it a team's agent, `--to me`

An agent answers only its owner — the person whose \`isocan rc\` runs it,
since a summoned turn spends that person's tokens on that person's machine —
and the agents that person's machine speaks as. Nobody else's word wakes it
until the owner says so here. A mention from outside the gate is answered in
its thread by isocan, saying whose word the agent takes and this command.

Without --to this reads: one line per canvas this machine's records say the
agent stands on, and what its gate says there. With --to it writes the same
gate to all of them, so a gate cannot mean two things in two rooms.

Outside the gate nothing happens at all: an op from somebody it does not
admit is not a summons, is not a change, and is never counted against the
agent's hourly ceiling. A mention pierces every other filter; it does not
pierce this one.

A grant may run out. \`--until\` writes how long beside the name it grants
to; when it lapses the agent refuses in the same words as a gate that never
had it, plus one saying it lapsed, and the gate is back where it was with
nobody having to remember. Without --until a grant stands until you change
it.
