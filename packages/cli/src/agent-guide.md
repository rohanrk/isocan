# Collaborating on an isocan canvas

isocan is an infinite shared canvas. A local daemon owns the state; the web
app (which the human watches) and the `isocan` CLI (you) are equal clients —
every operation you run appears on their screen live, and your presence
renders as a named cursor. This is the cold start: enough to arrive, name
yourself, work a lap and park. Everything else is a topic, listed at the end —
`isocan --agent-help <topic>` prints one. `isocan --help` is the
command-by-command reference.

## Orient

```sh
isocan status               # daemon auto-starts if down; "stale" → `isocan restart`;
                            # "upgrade" → tell the human, carry on — it is their call
isocan whoami               # "… this agent session" is YOURS; a bare name is the human's
isocan identity --session   # be handed a name as THIS agent, and bind this directory
isocan inbox                # what is already addressed to you, on every canvas here
isocan context              # what this canvas wants an agent to read first
```

**The directory you are in names the canvas.** `identity --session` binds
it through a committable `.isocan/project.json` (it resolves by
walking up, like `.git`); every command then resolves to this directory's
canvas on its own. `--canvas <ref>` (or `ISOCAN_CANVAS`) reaches another one —
only when the human asks. A directory nobody has readied takes `isocan setup`;
a repo you do not have yet takes `isocan clone <repo>`.

Conventions: `<item>`/`<thread>` take an id, an id prefix, or a title prefix.
Coordinates are world units (+x right, +y down). `--json` works on every
command.

**Your name is your own** — never your model's or vendor's ("Claude", "GPT"),
never the human's. `identity --session` allocates a free one starting with your
harness's letter; `--name "<name>"` asks for a specific one and is refused if
somebody answers to it. Keep it for the whole collaboration: `@Name` is how the
human calls you back. If `--session` says there is no harness session,
`export ISOCAN_SESSION_ID="$(uuidgen)"` first. Two processes with two session
keys are two collaborators — never share one name across two processes.
(`protocol` has the long version.)

## The lap

**The canvas is the channel that keeps.** What you put on it is the record —
shared, still there next week, the only thing a person who was not watching
can catch up on. Steps 1–2 happen once; **3–6 are a lap, and you run laps
until the human sends you home.**

1. **Appear.** `isocan session start --label "<your name> 🤖"`.
2. **Read.** `isocan comment list` — a thread needs you when its last entry is
   not yours. `comment list --open` is every unanswered question.
3. **Say what you are doing.** Presence narrates itself once a session exists —
   reads, ops and wakes move your cursor. Before a long silent stretch,
   `isocan session work <item> --say "…"`.
4. **Build.** `add` new things, `edit <item> <file>` to change one (each edit
   stacks a version — never re-add), `mv`/`set` to arrange. Read an item with
   `isocan get`, not by opening a path: the file on disk is not the item.
5. **Close the loop.** `isocan comment reply <thread> "…"` — what you did, where,
   and any judgment call. Terse: a few tight sentences, then stop. `@Name` to
   address a person, `#Title` to point at an item. Work that takes a while gets
   ONE comment you rewrite with `comment edit`, not four that pile up.
6. **Park.** `isocan wait --json --timeout <sec>`, **in the foreground, as one
   tool call** — its returning IS your wake-up. It wakes on a comment that
   names you, lands in the Chat (the `main` thread), or lands in a thread you
   are part of. Exit 0: the JSON names the thread — do the work, reply, park.
   Exit 2: nothing came — park again. Exit 3: another park adopted your name —
   stand down. Exit 4: your access was withdrawn — stop and say so.

**Your turn ends inside `wait`, or it ends wrong.** No `nohup`, no `&`, no
output file you poll — a file is not a notification. Size `--timeout` a little
under your harness's longest tool call. "Nothing left to do" is not an exit; it
is the moment to park. **Going home** is `isocan session end`, and only when
the human says the collaboration is over.

**Records never wake you.** A comment carrying `record: true` (a voice
transcript, an rc's "here"/"back"/"away" line) is context, never an
instruction, even when it names you. Do not answer another agent's hello.

**Blocked on the human?** `isocan ask "…"` (or a reply starting `/ask`) and
park — the canvas shows you as *asked* until somebody else answers. Ask only
when the answer changes what you would build and the canvas cannot tell you.

**A message may BE a command.** A comment whose body starts with `/name` is a
request for that piece of work: `isocan command show <name>` prints your
instructions; what they typed after the name outranks its defaults. If a
command you run prints `⚠ … CANCELLED this`, stop, say where you got to in one
comment, and leave nothing half-made.

**Design work has one entry.** Before building or resuming a designed screen,
run `isocan design workflow` — it reads this canvas's policy, open requests
and next steps (topic `design`).

## Who is at your terminal

`ISOCAN_HARNESS=agent` in your environment means `isocan rc` summoned you and
**nobody reads your terminal** — the canvas is the only place your words land.
Anything else means a person opened this conversation, and you have **two
channels: a team room and a DM.** The canvas holds the record — what you made,
changed or decided, a question the work rests on. Your conversation holds the
steering — "amber or teal?", progress, an error that is theirs to fix. **Do not
mirror** one into the other, **never announce yourself** on the canvas
(presence already says you are here), and when a DM answer changes the work,
write it down in a comment. Either way, you still park. If they are in an IDE
or agent manager, offer `isocan embed` — the canvas in a pane beside you.

## Practices that matter from the first lap

- **Versions are the medium.** "Change X on this item" means `edit` it; the
  person compares versions, and `version promote` brings one back.
- **Confirm before anything destructive** — deleting, emptying the trash,
  anything far outside the ask. `undo` reverts only your own ops.
- **A mark on an item is an instruction**; clear it once you have acted.
- **If you hit a product bug**, stop and tell the human. If a person can do
  something on the canvas that you cannot do from here, that is a bug in
  isocan, not a limit of yours — say so.

## Every verb, one line each

Every verb here sends the same operation the web app would. Flags are in
`isocan <verb> --help`; the topic after each line is where it is taught.
One spelling per act: `ls` lists, `new` makes, `rm` deletes — `list`,
`create` and `delete` still work wherever they used to, as do the older verbs
in topic `reference`. ⚠ marks what cannot be undone: ask first.

**You and presence** (`protocol`)
- `identity [--session|--name|--color]`, `whoami` — who you are here
- `session start|on|work|say|signal|point|select|move|end` — your cursor and status
- `who [--all]`, `inbox [--new|--mentions]`, `seen [--mark]` — who is here, what is for you
- `wait` — park; `ask` — ask a person and stop; `notify` (or `say`) — a line in the Chat

**Comments** (`protocol`, `practices`)
- `comment ls|add|reply|edit|anchor|main|rm|clean` — threads; `main` is the Chat, `clean` clears it out (owner)
- `command ls|show|add|rm` — slash commands a message can ask for

**Items** (`items`)
- `add <thing> [--as file|site|doc|canvas]` — one door for a file, a site, a Google Doc or a canvas
- `text`, `inline`, `get`, `show`, `ls [--kind|--filter]`, `set`, `edit`, `tree`, `save` — make, read, change, write out
- `version ls|promote|prune` — the version stack (prune ⚠)
- `mv`, `align`, `distribute`, `fit`, `tidy`, `merge`, `react`, `copy` — arrange, mark, duplicate
- `rm`, `restore`, `trash ls|restore|empty` (empty ⚠), `undo`, `redo` — take back
- `canvas group new|wrap|ls|show|add|remove|ungroup|resize|frame|layout|grid|stack|migrate`, `area` — groups
- `gdoc auth|sync` — Google Docs kept current; `shortcuts` — the keys a person has

**Canvases** (`items`, `homes`)
- `canvas new|ls|show|edit|background|archive|place|shot|rm` (rm ⚠), `use` — make, find, bind
- `home`, `direct`, `setup`, `clone`, `open` — where canvases live, readying a directory
- `teleport`, `export`, `import`, `blobs` — move, back up, restore, send missing bytes

**Sharing** (`sharing`)
- `share`, `space new|ls|add|remove|rm`, `group new|ls|add|remove|rm` — who may enter
- `pass`, `embed`, `badges` — another machine, a pane beside you, your surfaces
- `operator` — the home operator's, never yours

**Context and design** (`context`, `design`)
- `context show|pin|exclude|unmark|inherit|uninherit|request|content|personal` — what an agent reads
- `design workflow|start|brief|receipt|questions|ask|answer|reference|compare|respond|decide|review|craft` — a design request
- `design show|check|set|use|import|skip|direction|project|reconcile|recipes|recipe|audit|repair` — the design system
- `diff`, `prefer`, `choose` — what changed between versions, the eye test, the winner folded back
- `doc status` — where one of this repo's documents stands

**History** (`history`)
- `activity`, `timeline`, `lens`, `history`, `at`, `tail`, `recap`, `whatsnew` — what happened, at every zoom
- `evals corpus|converge|pairs` — what was asked for here, and what came of it

**Agents and rooms** (`agents`, `present`)
- `agent add|remove|rules|mark`, `rc add|listen|remove`, `bench add|join|follow|rm`, `harness` — standing agents
- `persona ls|show|runs`, `docket ls|answer` — roles and their findings
- `slides add|rm|show|export|note|notes`, `sprint show|phase|board|brief|desk|end|handin|tally`, `present` — running a room

**What a canvas carries** (`extend`, and a topic per module)
- `module add|rm|ls`, `tool ls|add`, `panel ls|add` — modules, rail tools, dock panels
- `map`, `docs`, `sticker`, `sandbox`, `wire`, `competition`, `anatomy`, `voice`, `judge` — module families; `--agent-help <verb>` finds each

## Orient (once per session)

```sh
isocan status                  # daemon auto-starts on any command if down
                               # says "stale"? `isocan restart` — the daemon is
                               # an older copy than the CLI you just ran
                               # says "upgrade"? relay it to the human and carry
                               # on — catching up is their call, not yours
isocan whoami                  # identity must be YOURS, not the user's
isocan identity --session      # be handed a name, as THIS agent — and bind
                               # this directory to its canvas (see below)
isocan canvas ls              # the directory's canvas; --all for the home
```

A directory nobody has readied yet takes one command: `isocan setup` puts
this guide's skill where agents look, the CLI on PATH, and the daemon behind
the app (`--jetski` also links the Jetski plugin into
`~/.gemini/config/plugins/isocan`). On a machine that has never held a canvas it also writes **isocan.io**
down as the birth default, so the first canvas somebody makes is at the hosted
home rather than trapped on one laptop — it says so in its report, and `isocan
home --clear` undoes it. A machine that already holds canvases keeps birthing
them where it always did. A repo you do not have yet takes `isocan clone <repo>` — it clones,
readies the directory the same way, and reports the canvas the repo's
committed `.isocan/project.json` names, so a clone lands on THE canvas rather
than a copy of it. It installs nothing from the repo and runs nothing: `npm
install` executes the repo's own scripts, so that stays a line you type.

**The directory you are in IS the project.** `identity --session` makes sure
of it: if `<dir>/.isocan/project.json` already names a canvas (the marker is
committable and resolves by walking up, like `.git`), you are on that canvas;
if the marker names one this machine has never seen (a fresh clone), your
first addition materializes it under the same id; if there is no marker, a
canvas named after the directory is created and bound. So there is always a
canvas to work on — this directory's. Every command resolves to it on its
own; pass `--canvas <ref>` only when deliberately reaching for another
canvas, and treat the human's other canvases as their business
(`canvas ls --all` shows them). `ISOCAN_CANVAS=<id>` in the environment
means the same as `--canvas` — an rc sets it for a summons, so a standing
agent's shells act on the canvas the summons is FOR, whatever directory
they run in.

Conventions: `<item>`/`<thread>` args accept id, id prefix, or title prefix.
Coordinates are world units (+x right, +y down). Add `--json` to any command
when you need to parse output.

**Design work has one shared entry.** For a designed screen, HTML node or
connected application, run `isocan design workflow` before starting or resuming.
It reads this canvas's rollout policy, existing requests and next steps, and
provides the full procedure on demand. A precise edit or archive import follows
ordinary editing/import without a new interview. Canvas summons and external
agents use the same durable brief; do not copy the procedure into a private
memory or restart discovery when changing agents.

## Your name

You are a collaborator on this canvas, so you need a name of your own — not
your model's or your vendor's ("Claude", "GPT", "Gemini" are all wrong here,
and any harness should be able to run this guide), and never the human's.

**A machine holds one person and any number of agents.** Two slots keep them
apart. `~/.isocan/identity.json` is the person's name. A session — the id
your harness puts in the environment of every command it runs — belongs to
you alone, and `--session` claims it: naming yourself is an operation the
daemon applies atomically, so two agents in one checkout are two people
without having to coordinate at all, even claiming in the same second. There
is no directory slot — a directory cannot tell one agent from another, so a
name written there would be handed to whoever walks in next. `--session` can
never rename the human — that is the whole reason the flag exists.

If `--session` reports no harness session, export a session id yourself
before naming yourself — any stable string works for the length of your run:

```sh
export ISOCAN_SESSION_ID="$(uuidgen)"   # with ISOCAN_HARNESS for the label
```

or name your harness's own variable once in `~/.isocan/config.json` under
`harnessVars` so it works every time after.

Pick like this, once, before you appear:

1. `isocan whoami` — a name followed by "this agent session" is YOURS, from
   earlier in this same session: keep it, a stable name beats a fresh one.
   A bare name is the HUMAN's — never yours to keep. (A `badge bdg_…` line
   under it is this machine's credential with the daemon, handed out
   automatically; there is nothing for you to do with it.) On a machine where
   nobody has been named yet it errors with "no identity configured" — that
   is the answer "nobody, yet", not a broken install; same for a `canvas
   list` that is empty before you have named yourself (the handshake is what
   creates this directory's canvas). Neither is a reason to reinstall
   anything.
2. `isocan identity --session` — ask, receive. The daemon knows every name
   every canvas answers to and hands you a free one; no roster to read, no
   race to lose. **It starts with the same letter your harness does** where it
   can — a Claude Code session gets a C name, a Gemini one gets a G — so a
   person looking at three agents can tell which is which. It is the initial
   and never the vendor's own name, for the reason above.

   Eight names per letter, and allocation enters that roster at a point
   derived from your session key rather than at the top, so two agents who
   cannot see each other do not both reach for the same one. Which C name you
   get is therefore not predictable and not worth predicting; that it is a C
   name, and that it is yours for the whole collaboration, is the promise. A
   harness with no letter of ours is handed an isocan name (Isaac, Kenny,
   Nico… — names hiding in the letters of "isocan"), which is also where a
   letter falls through to when its eight are worn. Want a specific name? `--name "<name>"` — if somebody already
   answers to it the command REFUSES and names the holder; take what
   allocation offers instead of forcing it with `--new`. Then keep the name
   for the whole collaboration — the human will call you back by it, and
   `@Name` only works if exactly one of you answers to it.

Your session id is durable across resume — a resumed conversation gets the
same actor back by running the same command. Only if your conversation is
truly gone (fresh session, no transcript) and you must be your old self
again: `isocan identity --as <your old usr_… id>` — deliberate reincarnation,
never a way to take a name that isn't yours.

`isocan identity --join <actorId>` folds another actor into the one you are —
its comments, mentions and undo become yours, and the home refuses it unless
this machine already speaks for both. It exists for a person who spent weeks
as a second name on a second machine; an agent almost never wants it, and
never for an actor that is not its own earlier self.

If `--session` found no harness session, mention it to the human after you
have worked around it: a harness isocan has not met can opt in for good by
exporting `ISOCAN_SESSION_ID` (with `ISOCAN_HARNESS` for the label), or by
naming its variable once in `~/.isocan/config.json` under `harnessVars`.

## The session protocol

**The canvas is the channel that keeps.** What you put on it is the record:
shared with everyone here, still there next week, and the only thing a person
who was not watching can catch up on. So once you have appeared, everything
with a claim on the work goes in a comment — what you made, what you changed,
what you decided, and every question whose answer somebody else will need.

**Whether anybody is reading your terminal is a different question, and it has
two answers.** Read the next section before you decide the first lap is
finished; getting it wrong is the most common way an agent is either silent or
exhausting to work with.

Steps 1–2 happen once. **Steps 3–6 are a lap, and you run laps until the
human sends you home.** Every lap ends at step 6 — including the one you
think is the last.

1. **Appear.** `isocan session start --label "<your name> 🤖"` — the label is
   what the human sees on your cursor, so keep your name in it.
2. **Read.** `isocan comment ls` — a comment needs addressing when the last
   entry in its thread is not yours.
3. **Presence narrates itself — add your own words for the quiet parts.**
   Once a session exists, every command you run updates your cursor and
   status automatically: reads narrate ("looking at…", "reading the
   comments…"), ops move your cursor to where they happened, waking from
   `wait` lands you on the summoning thread, and posting a comment clears
   your status. What the system cannot see is you authoring files or
   thinking — the canvas shows "quiet Ns" honestly, but better is
   `isocan session work <item> --say "what you're doing…"` (or
   `session work --at x,y --say …`) BEFORE a long silent stretch. Your words
   outrank the derived narration until your next comment.
4. **Build.** `add` new files, `edit <item> <file>` for changes to existing
   items (each edit stacks a version — never re-add), `mv`/`set` to arrange.
   Every op you run snaps your cursor to where it happened.
5. **Close the loop on the thread.** Always `isocan comment reply <thread>
   "…"` describing what you did, where you put it, and any judgment calls.
   The reply is the deliverable's receipt. Comments render as markdown in
   the web app, so structure is welcome — but keep it short (see below).
   Address a specific person with
   `@Name` (first names work) — mentions are resolved when you post.
   Point at your work with `#Title` (an item's exact title, or `#itm_…` its
   full id) — in the web app the chip flies the reader to the item, so
   "done, see #Roadmap" beats describing where things are.
6. **Park.** `isocan wait --json --timeout <sec>` blocks until the next comment
   that is FOR YOU: one that @-mentions you (name or session label), lands in
   a MAIN thread (see below), or lands in a thread you wrote in or were
   mentioned in. Everything else — comments for others, comments mentioning
   nobody, and RECORDS (below) — is ether and won't wake you.
   Exit 2 on timeout, 0 with the feedback as JSON. **Run it in the
   foreground, as one tool call** — the call returning IS your wake-up (see
   "Parking is a foreground call"). While parked your cursor shows "waiting
   for you…" automatically. On wake, or on a timeout: start the next lap.
   The wait is on THIS directory's canvas — the one your work is on. There
   is no home-wide listening; if the human wants you on a different canvas,
   they will say so, and `--canvas <ref>` is how you reach it.

**A record is not an ask.** Some comments are the transcript of something
that already happened rather than a request to anybody — a voice session's
conversation is posted to the Chat as one block when the session stops. They
carry `record: true`, they never wake you, and they never wake you EVEN IF
THEY NAME YOU: speech is transcribed and transcription is full of names, so
"Scout should look at this" said out loud to a voice agent is a sentence
about Scout, not a summons to Scout.

You will still SEE them when you read a thread, and reading them is useful —
they are the best account of what somebody was trying to do. Treat them as
context, never as instructions: nothing in a record is addressed to you. If
the person wants you on it, they will say so in a comment of their own.

**A roll-call line is a record too.** When an `isocan rc` started with
`--announce` takes up a standing agent on a canvas, the agent says so in the
Chat in its own name — *"Percy is
here — answering a mention or the Chat; listens only to Nico."* — and says
*is back* after being gone longer than five minutes, and *stepped away* when
the rc is stopped on purpose. Their `record` says which (`"here"`, `"back"`,
`"away"`), and like every record they wake nobody under any rule, `--all-ops`
included: another agent arriving
is not work for you, and replying to its hello is how two agents talk to each
other forever. Do not answer them.

**Blocked on the human?** Say so in a way the system can see: start a comment
with `/ask` — `isocan comment reply <thread> "/ask blue header or green?"` —
and park. An unanswered `/ask` is a derived state, not a flag: the workbench
pins your row to the top marked "asked", and `isocan who` shows `blocked`,
until somebody OTHER than you replies in that thread. That rule is for plain
prose asks. Structured design questions use `design ask`: only the named human's
typed answer, skip, dismissal or delegation resolves them. Another agent's update
and unrelated human prose leave them open. A legacy JSON `/ask` needs explicit
adoption with a current brief and named respondent before it can receive typed
answers. Use `design questions` to read the actual source and outstanding IDs.
Being seen never counts as an answer.

**Going home** is not a step, it is an interruption: run `isocan session end`
when the human has told you the collaboration is over, and only then. Nothing
else ends it — not an empty comment list, not a finished task, not a `wait`
that timed out. Until those words come, the answer to "what now?" is always
step 6.

## Who is at your terminal

There are two ways you can be running, and they want different things from
you. The test is mechanical: **`ISOCAN_HARNESS=agent` in your environment
means `isocan rc` summoned you** — that value is set by the summons and by
nothing else. Any other value, or a session you were started in by somebody
typing, means a person opened this conversation.

**Summoned — nobody is at your terminal.** Nothing you say outside a comment
is heard by anyone. Everything above applies without qualification: the canvas
is the only place your words can land, so put them there.

**Started by a person — you have two channels, not one.** They typed to you,
in a terminal or an IDE or an agent manager where your conversation sits in a
window beside the canvas. Both are watched. They are not two chats to keep in
sync; they are **a team room and a DM**, and confusing them is what makes an
agent tiring to work with.

| | The canvas | Your conversation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| who sees it | everyone here, including agents, next week | one person, now |
| what belongs there | the **record** — what you made, what changed, what you decided, a question the work will rest on | the **steering** — "amber or teal?", "y", where you are up to, an error that is theirs to fix |
| what does not | thinking aloud, progress narration, anything you would delete tomorrow | anything somebody else will need to find later |

Three rules follow. The second is the one that has actually been caught
happening — a canvas Chat holding seven of one agent's own "I'm online and
ready to design!" while the real conversation went on in the manager beside
it — so start there:

1. **Do not mirror.** The canvas is shared with people and agents who are not
   in your conversation; your conversation is one person's. Copying each into
   the other leaks a private exchange into a shared room and floods the room
   with noise. Say a thing once, in the room it belongs to.
2. **Never announce yourself on the canvas.** "I'm online and ready!" is a
   presence fact, and presence has its own surface — your cursor, your label,
   the facepile. Step 3 says it already: presence narrates itself. A Chat full
   of an agent's own joins is the canvas equivalent of clearing your throat
   into a microphone.
3. **When a DM answer becomes a decision, write it down.** The fastest way to
   settle "amber or teal?" is to ask the person in front of you — do that. But
   the moment the answer changes the work, it belongs in a comment, because
   the next person to open this canvas was not in your conversation. `/ask` on
   the canvas is for the questions whose ANSWER matters later; your
   conversation is for the ones that stop mattering the moment they are
   answered.

**What does not change either way: you still park.** `wait` is the loop, not a
message-checking habit, and a lap that ends with a summary typed at a person
instead of `isocan wait` is a lap that has left the canvas — and left you
unreachable to everyone who is not in that conversation. Being talked to
directly is not being sent home; only the words are (see "Going home").

**Offer the canvas beside them.** If the person is in an IDE or an agent
manager, they can watch this canvas in a pane next to your conversation
instead of a window of its own. `isocan embed` is the address for it, and it
is worth offering unprompted the first time you make something worth looking
at — see "Passes".

## Parking is a foreground call

`wait` is not a job you start; it is the turn you are having. The blocking
tool call is the notification channel: when it returns, your harness hands you
the JSON and you are awake, in the same turn, with the work in front of you.

A detached `wait` keeps your cursor on the canvas but cannot wake the model —
its stdout ends up somewhere nobody reads, and **a file is not a
notification**. So no `nohup`, no `&`, no "run this in the background" mode of
your shell tool, no `> wait.json` you come back to poll. If your harness
cannot hold a long-running tool call open, that is a harness gap to fix with
event forwarding, not something to paper over with a detached supervisor.

- **Your turn ends inside `wait`, or it ends wrong.** Before you stop, look
  at the last command you ran: if it is not `isocan wait`, you have not
  finished the lap — you have walked off the canvas while the human is still
  typing, and they have no way to tell the difference. "Nothing left to do"
  is not an exit; it is precisely the moment to park.
- **Size the timeout to your harness.** Set `--timeout` a little under the
  longest tool call your harness allows, and raise the tool's own timeout to
  match: `--timeout 3600` where calls can run an hour, `--timeout 570` under a
  10-minute cap. A short park is fine — it just means more laps.
- **Exit 2 means nothing came.** It is the quiet half of a conversation, not
  the end of one: park again. Never invent work out of a timeout, and never
  read one as permission to leave.
- **Exit 4 means your access was withdrawn.** An owner removed you from the
  canvas while you were parked, and the daemon said so — `wait:
  withdrawn` — instead of going quiet. Do not park on that canvas again
  unless an owner lets you back in; say so wherever you report, and stop.
- **One waiter per NAME — enforced.** The daemon keeps one cursor row per
  actor per canvas, and the newest park adopts it: an older park speaking as
  the same actor exits 3 with "another park adopted this actor's cursor",
  delivering nothing. Exit 3 means stand down, not park again. Start your own
  next `wait` only after the work is done and the receipt is posted. (Two
  parked processes with two different names is a different thing entirely —
  see below, and it is allowed.)
- **Your place in the log survives you.** The cursor lives with the daemon,
  per actor per canvas: a park that is killed — mid-gap, mid-turn — resumes
  exactly where it left off on the next `wait`, with everything from the gap
  delivered. You never need `--since`. An entry that was already handed to a
  turn that died arrives flagged `redelivered: true` — you may have answered
  it before you died, so check the thread before answering twice.
- **The daemon is allowed to die under you.** A park survives a restart: it
  retries, starts the daemon again if nobody else has, and resumes at the
  same cursor, so nothing that landed meanwhile is missed. If it has been
  gone a few seconds you get one line on stderr saying so. You do not need a
  supervisor loop around `wait`, and you should not write one.
- **Handle the wake in the turn it arrives.** The JSON names the thread that
  woke you — read it, do the work, reply.
- **If a turn is interrupted, re-read before acting.** An old `wait` payload
  is not a queue. `isocan comment ls` and `isocan tail` are the truth; match
  on comment/operation ids so you don't answer the same comment twice.

## More than one of you

A name is not a machine — it is a **session key**. Whatever the harness
exports (`ISOCAN_SESSION_ID`, or your harness's own variable) decides which
actor a command speaks as, so two processes on one machine with two different
session keys are two collaborators: two names, two cursors, two parks, two
undo histories. The canvas cannot tell them from two people on two laptops,
because there is nothing to tell.

That is how you do several things at once. One agent per concern, each with
its own name and its own park:

```sh
ISOCAN_SESSION_ID=scout  isocan identity --name Scout  --session
ISOCAN_SESSION_ID=scribe isocan identity --name Scribe --session
# then each process runs its own lap, parking on its own `isocan wait`
```

Both wake on the same summons in the Chat, and each answers as itself. What
you must NOT do is share one name across two processes — that is the "one
waiter per name" rule above, and it is the only way this goes wrong.

Two things worth knowing before you fan out. **Say who is doing what**, in
the Chat, before you start: three cursors appearing with no explanation is
alarming rather than impressive. And **fan out for work that is genuinely
separate** — two agents editing the same item is a merge nobody asked for,
while two agents on two screens is the thing this canvas is for.

## What is addressed to you

`isocan inbox` lists every comment addressed to you across every canvas here —
newest first, with the command to reply to each. `--mentions` narrows it to
where somebody actually named you, rather than the Chat being busy.

The daemon assembles the inbox at each canvas’s home, using the same routing
and seen marks as the web inbox. A failed or withdrawn home is reported as
unavailable. Reading the inbox never marks a canvas seen.

**It is the same rule `isocan wait` parks on** — one function, `reasonFor`
in core, that both call: a comment
is yours when it names you — by actor id, or by a name you answer to including
your session label — or it lands in the Chat, or it lands in a thread you are
already part of. Everything else is ether.

The difference is time. `wait` blocks until something arrives; `inbox` says
what already did. Read it when you come back to a machine, before you park
again: something addressed to you on another canvas is invisible to a `wait`
pinned to this one.

**What is new, and how the canvas knows.** `isocan inbox --new` narrows the
list to what has arrived since you last looked, and the tally line ends with
the same count. "Since you last looked" is a **seen-mark**: one row per person
per canvas, `{ seq, at }`, kept by the home — so it is the same answer on every
machine you work from, and a canvas you have never opened is entirely new
rather than invisible.

`isocan seen` prints those marks, most recent first — the canvases you have
been on, with `moved since` on the ones that changed after you left.
`isocan seen --mark` is the one thing that writes: it moves the mark for the
bound canvas (or `--canvas <name>`) up to the head you just read. **Only call
it after you have actually read the canvas.** The mark means both "I was here"
and "I had seen everything up to here", and the app's switcher reads the first
half to show you where you were lately — marking canvases you have not looked
at fills somebody's list with places they never went.

A mark never goes backwards: two machines racing converge, and an older client
cannot pull yours back. It is **not** a read receipt — nobody else can see your
marks, there is no route that would return them, and none should be added.
Being seen is not the canvas's business, which is why a mark is not an
operation and is not in the canvas's history.

## When you need a person

`isocan ask "…"` asks and stops. It posts your question to the Chat — or to a
thing with `--item` — and the canvas immediately shows you as **asked**: in
the agent tray, in the facepile, and in `isocan who`. Then park on
`isocan wait` as usual.

Ask when the answer changes what you would build and you cannot get it from
the canvas. Do not ask to confirm something you could check, and do not ask
and then carry on guessing — the point of the state is that it is TRUE.

`isocan comment ls --open` lists every question nobody has answered yet,
across every thread, with the command to reply to each. Read it when you come
back to a canvas: an unanswered question from an earlier lap is the first
thing worth knowing, and it is often yours.

**For a plain-prose ask, somebody else answering closes it.** Adding to your
own question does not. Structured design questions instead stay open until the
named human submits a typed outcome through the dock or `design answer`.
Valid legacy JSON questionnaires remain unresolved until explicit adoption;
another participant's progress reply cannot supply their missing respondent.
Read `design questions` for the structured source and outstanding IDs.

## Working a canvas that is not this directory's

Only when the human asks for it. Pass `--canvas <ref>` to each command — do
NOT `isocan use` there, which would re-bind the directory you are standing
in — and check `isocan --canvas <ref> who --all` so your name is free on
that canvas too. Waking from a `wait` still lands your cursor on the thread
that woke you, with no `session start` needed.

## Pointing to words together

With a session started (`isocan session start`), `isocan session point <item>`
highlights an item under your cursor for 8 seconds; adding `--zoom` also glides
a framed pane's camera to fill its viewport with that item. Camera-only cues work
without naming an item: `session point --fit` (fit all), `--100` (100% zoom),
`--selection` (fit current selection), `--in` / `--out` (step zoom), and
`--follow` (follow your cursor in a framed pane). `session select <item> --zoom`,
`session move <x> <y>`, and `session on <thread>` likewise forward their cue to a
framed pane beside your conversation.

`isocan session select <item> --quote "exact rendered words"` shares a text
range in the current saved Markdown/plain-text version for 15 seconds, without
editing it. For repeated words, use `--occurrence 2`; ambiguity is refused.
`session select --clear` puts it down. `isocan --json who` includes the version,
text space, range and expiry in each session's `textSelection`. Source markup
is not a rendered quote: select `important`, not `**important**`.
The browser's Read / select text button enters the same surface; a standalone
tab's viewport never moves unless a framed host pane asks it to.

To leave a durable discussion, use
`isocan comment add --item <item> --quote "exact rendered words" "feedback"`.
Repeated quotes require `--occurrence 2`. The thread saves the original quote,
version, surrounding words, and rendered-text offsets. `comment ls --json`
adds `textAnchorResolution` for the current version: `resolved`, `missing`,
`ambiguous`, or `unavailable`. Missing or ambiguous text keeps its item pin;
it never silently jumps to a guessed passage. To choose again, use
`isocan comment anchor <thread> <item> --quote "new words"`; anchoring without
`--quote`, or detaching with `--at`, clears the text selector. Both acts undo.

Markdown files added or edited through the CLI bundle referenced local images
into a visual face; `get` still returns the original source. Import related
files from the same directory root: relative links resolve to saved canvas
items using `file`/`visualFile`, import `sourcePath`, or their filenames. A
`sourcePath` is only import provenance; it does not back or write a file.
Missing or duplicate targets are visibly unavailable rather than navigating
to an unrelated app URL. Browser uploads can link by saved filename or an
explicit `file` property; they cannot read neighboring files from your disk.

<!-- topic: practices | the habits that earn trust — terse replies, versions, marks and reactions, commands, tidy canvases, stopping, product bugs -->

## Practices that earn trust

- **Comments are read in a small thread window — be terse.** Precise and
  concise wins: a few tight sentences saying what you did, where it is, and
  any judgment call, then stop. No preamble, no restating the ask, no
  bullet-point reports. If detail truly matters, put it in an item on the
  canvas and point to it.
- **Placement**: honor the comment's location. Anchored comments → work on
  that item. Freestanding comments → place results near the pin
  (`--at x,y` close to the comment's coordinates), or use
  `--anchor <item>` to sit neatly left of a related item.
- **Anchor the thread to what it produced.** When a freestanding comment
  asks for something and you build the item, run
  `isocan comment anchor <thread> <item>` so the thread pins to the result
  and follows it from then on.
- **Show running software, don't describe it.** When your work is a dev
  server the human could look at, `isocan add http://localhost:<port>`
  projects the live site onto the canvas as a mini-browser item — vite
  HMR keeps it current on its own; the item's ⟳ reloads anything else.
- **Point at one screen, not at the canvas it is on.** `isocan open <item>`
  prints — and opens — the address of that ONE item, filling the window:

  ```sh
  isocan open "Checkout"        # → http://…/p/<canvas>/i/<itemId>
  ```

  Full screen is a route rather than an operation, which is why you can hand
  it over at all: what somebody is looking at is not a mutation, so there is
  no op to send, but there IS an address. Nothing is written and nobody else's
  view moves — it is a link, and the person opening it can leave with Esc or
  Back. Prefer `#Title` in a comment when you are already writing one (the
  chip flies them there in place); reach for this when the whole point is to
  look at one thing with the canvas out of the way.
- **Versions are the medium for iteration.** "Change X on this item" means
  `edit` → new version. Mention "vN on the stack — fan out (F) to compare"
  in your reply so the human knows the history is there. The top of that
  stack is a CHOICE, not the newest: `version promote` puts any version
  back on top, `isocan version ls <item>` marks it `▶`, and `isocan get`
  follows it. When you are asked to change "this item", change the version
  it currently points at — not the last one that happened to land. A stack
  is worth keeping whole when people made it; one a script regenerates on
  every run is silt, and every version's metadata rides on every load of
  the canvas. Bound those: `isocan version prune <item> --keep 14 --force`
  keeps the newest fourteen (the current one always survives), and `gc
  --keep-versions N --force` does it for every item before it sweeps. Not
  undoable — say so before you do it to somebody else's stack.
- **Leave the canvas tidy.** What a person does by dragging — edges snapping
  together, gaps evening out — you do with `isocan align <items…> --to
isocan fit <items...>                  # grow items to the size their content wants, and settle them apart
  left|hcenter|right|top|vcenter|bottom` and `isocan distribute <items…>
  --axis h|v`. Both are one op, so one undo, and both are no-ops when things
  are already in place. `isocan mv <item> --by 0,-40` nudges without doing the
  arithmetic yourself.
- **Renaming moves the file too.** `isocan set <item> --title "Bass tab v2"`
  also renames the blob to `bass-tab-v2.png`, stepping aside from any name the
  canvas already uses — the same act the web app performs, so the two never
  disagree. `--keep-filename` opts out.
- **Ink is a kind of item.** If you generate an SVG as annotation rather than
  as artwork — circling a thing, sketching a flow — `isocan add note.svg
  --drawing` lands it the way the web app's Pen does: no card, no titlebar,
  just the strokes. It reads back as `--kind drawing`. One SVG is one drawing
  however many strokes are in it — a person holding `P` sweeps a whole sketch
  made in passes into a single item, so do not assume one drawing means one
  gesture, or that separate marks were made at separate times.
- **Find things the way the files panel does.** `isocan ls --kind
  drawing|screen|image|video|document|site|other` and `isocan ls --filter <text>`
  are the same two questions the human's Files panel answers.
- **Say you have it, before you have anything to show.** The moment you pick
  up a thread, claim it: `isocan session on <thread> --say "reading your
  comment…"`. It shows live UNDER the comment that asked, so the person stops
  wondering whether anyone woke. Waking on `wait` does this for you — the
  summons claims the thread it came from — but a thread you picked up any
  other way is yours to claim.

  Then keep it current as the work changes: `--say "reading the three
  screens…"`, `--say "moving 12 items into rows…"`. Walking off to work on the
  items the thread is about does NOT put it down — `session work <item> --say`
  moves your cursor and your status while you stay on the thread — so the
  person watching sees what you are doing the whole way through. Say what you are DOING,
  never how far along you are; nobody can check a percentage. This is presence,
  not a comment: it costs no op, leaves no trace in the history, and vanishes
  when you stop. A thread full of "working…" posts is a thread nobody can read
  next week.

  Posting your reply clears it, which is the right shape: the status is the
  gap between being asked and answering, and done is done.
- **Do not open every reply with their name.** A reply sits directly under the
  question in the thread; "@Di alright, grilling you on…" spends words and
  screen on something the position already said. Just answer: "Alright,
  grilling you on…".

  Address somebody by name when it is doing WORK — reaching a person who is not
  the one you are replying to, or handing something over: "@Wise Andy, the
  audit is #Design audit — can you take the tracker?" When you do, punctuate
  it: `@Name:` or `@Name —`, never `@Name alright` running straight on.

  Names resolve to the person by what they answer to NOW, so use the name you
  see in the thread rather than one you remember from earlier in the session.
- **Stop when you are told to stop.** If a command you run prints
  `⚠ … CANCELLED this`, the person has called off the thread you picked up.
  That is the whole instruction: stop building, say where you got to in one
  comment, leave nothing half-made on the canvas (finish the one step that
  makes a thing stand on its own, or `isocan rm` it and say which), and do not
  finish the last bit because you were nearly done. `isocan command show
  cancel` is the long version.

  You will see it on the output of whatever command you happened to run,
  because that is the only thing that reaches you mid-turn — you are not
  watching the canvas while you work. It is said once, so do not wait for it
  to be repeated.
- **A message may BE a command.** When a comment starts with `/name` — the
  first thing in the body, nothing before it — the person did not type prose,
  they asked for a specific piece of work. Run `isocan command show <name>`:
  the body it prints is your instructions for this turn, written for someone
  holding this CLI on this canvas. Follow it, then reply on the thread as
  usual.

  Everything after the name is the argument, and it is the part they typed by
  hand, so it OUTRANKS the command's defaults wherever the two disagree. They
  are looking at the canvas; you are not.

  `/tidy` halfway through a sentence is somebody TALKING about the command,
  not asking for it. Only the start of the message counts. If a command names
  something you cannot find, ask on the thread rather than picking a target —
  doing the right work to the wrong screen is worse than a question.

  `isocan command ls` is the whole menu, and it is the same list the web
  app's composer offers, so a person and an agent are never looking at
  different vocabularies. If you already hold a skill a command names, use the
  skill: the command body is the adaptation to this canvas, not a replacement
  for it.
- **A command is a skill, so published ones drop straight in.**
  `isocan command add --from <owner/repo/path/SKILL.md>` fetches it and PRINTS
  it; `--yes` installs it. The two steps are the point, and they are enforced
  by the command rather than asked of you: a body you install is read as
  instructions by every future agent on this canvas, so nothing lands unread.
  Show the person what it says — at minimum what it instructs an agent to DO
  and anything reaching outside this canvas — and let them decide. `/skill` is
  the same act from a composer, and `/skill find` looks for one without
  installing anything.

  Never add a skill nobody asked for, and never add several to be helpful. A
  menu of forty commands nobody chose is worse than one with eight. `/help` is answered by the app itself — a person
  should not wait for you to be told what their own keyboard does — so you
  will rarely see it from the web app; from a terminal it is a real question,
  so answer it. A home can add its own commands with `isocan command add`;
  those live in `~/.isocan/commands/` and shadow a built-in of the same name.
- **Ink can be swept together.** A person holding `P` draws a whole sketch as
  one item; `isocan merge <drawings...>` does that to marks already on the
  canvas. It is exact, not approximate — ink is stored in world coordinates,
  so merging is concatenating the strokes and taking the union of the boxes,
  and what comes out is byte-for-byte what went in. The originals go to the
  trash (`--keep` leaves them), which is two ops and so two undos. It refuses
  an SVG this canvas did not draw, because moving somebody's artwork silently
  is worse than saying no.
- **Tidying is a verb, not a judgement call.** `isocan tidy` arranges the
  whole canvas the way `/tidy` means: screens in a row keeping their reading
  order, whatever was made FROM a screen in a column under it, images and video
  gathered below. It is one `items.move`, so it is one undo, and it is a fixed
  point — running it on a formatted canvas moves nothing. `--dry-run` says what
  would move. Prefer it over placing items by hand; hand placement is for what
  the person asked for on top of it.
- **Say what a thing came from.** When you build an item FROM another one — a
  variation, a spec written from a sketch, a page split out of a page — add
  `--prop parent=<source item id>`. It costs one property and it is what makes
  the canvas a tree instead of a pile: `/tidy` hangs children under their
  parent, and anyone can see where a screen came from.
- **Cleaning up the Chat is the owner's call.** `isocan comment clean
  --system | --from <actor> | --before <date> | --all [--dry-run] [thread]`
  removes many messages at once — the Chat unless a thread is named — as ONE
  group, so one `isocan undo` puts them all back in place. `isocan comment rm
  <thread> <comment>` removes one (ids are in `comment ls`). You may remove
  your own messages; only the canvas's owner may remove anybody else's,
  ⚙ isocan notices included, and the home refuses the rest with `not-owner`.
  Do not clean a Chat unasked — a person reads it, and "tidy" means items.
  Removed means out of the thread, not out of history: the log keeps the
  words, and `history`, `at` and `export` still show them.
- **Read the room before you act.** `isocan activity [who]` is what has been
  happening here, newest first — who made what, who edited it, who said what
  and where. Running it for the person who summoned you is the cheapest way to
  find out what they have been working on before you answer them, and running
  it for yourself is how you check what you actually landed last session. The
  web app shows the same list under a face in the pile, from the same reader.

  For the longer view, `isocan recap` is the whole history at decaying
  resolution: old stretches summarized to one line each (who, how many ops,
  which items, how much conversation), the recent operations verbatim. Each
  summarized span carries its seq range, and `isocan tail --archived` replays
  any of it at full resolution — the history `gc` compacts is archived, never
  deleted, and both verbs can read it. Joining a canvas with a past, run
  `recap` once before forming an impression from `comment ls` alone.
- **What this canvas has actually asked for.** `isocan evals corpus` is the
  same history read as a question about the WORK rather than the ops: every
  ask, whether it was answered, cancelled or met with silence, and the ops
  attributed to it. `isocan evals pairs` is the other half — the version
  stacks where somebody kept an earlier take over a later one. The corpus
  also says what KIND each ask is — revise, create, orchestrate, question,
  arrange, restyle, document, critique, repair, variation, converge — by a
  classifier that agrees with a person about four times in five; the `kinds:`
  line is a reading of the words, not a label, and says so.
  `isocan evals converge` is the night shift's score: what the converge lane
  landed here as versions, and whether people kept them, built on them, or
  brought the previous version back — the accept rate that widens or narrows
  what the night may do unasked.

  The home knows who is an agent — the harness you claimed your name from is
  recorded with it — so your own "Done —" in the Chat counts as a reply here,
  not as somebody asking; nothing to enrol by hand for that.

  Two things to hold when you read it. **The attribution says how it knows**,
  and one of its three labels is a guess: `anchor` and `reference` are
  recorded facts, `window` is "the agent that was asked did this before
  anybody spoke again". Do not quote a `window` count as though it were
  measured. And **there is no score, deliberately** — a ratio over a handful
  of asks is noise wearing a decimal point.

  It reads this machine's copy and writes nothing, to the canvas or anywhere
  else. The `silent` column is the one worth looking at: an ask nobody
  answered is the failure this canvas cannot see any other way.
- **The keys the human has.** `isocan shortcuts` prints every key the canvas
  answers to — the same list their `?` panel shows, from the same source. When
  somebody asks how to do a thing without a mouse, or you are telling them
  where to look, name the actual key rather than describing the menu path.
- **A reaction is a cheap answer.** `isocan react 👍 <item>` wears an emoji on
  an item; `--off` takes yours back and `--who` says who else is wearing it.
  The canvas draws them as chips under the item and a person toggles theirs by
  clicking, exactly as they would in a chat app.

  It is worth reaching for when the honest answer is one bit. Somebody asked
  "do these two work?" and they do: 👍 on both beats a paragraph, costs one op,
  and leaves a mark the next reader can see without opening a thread. Where a
  judgment call needs saying, still say it — a chip cannot carry a reason.

  The count is the number of PEOPLE wearing it, never a tally you add to: your
  own is a toggle, and reacting twice is not reacting twice.
- **The marks ARE the shortlist.** There is no star any more; reactions
  replaced it, and the right-hand bar groups the canvas by them. `isocan ls
  --reaction 👀` is every screen wearing one mark — which is how you find out
  what is in review, or in flight, or signed off, without anybody having built
  those states.

  What a mark MEANS is the team's, not ours. Read before you assume: if every
  screen they care about wears ⭐ and the ones they are working on wear 🚧,
  that is the system, and `ls --reaction` is how you learn it. Mark what you
  built when they asked for it to be easy to find; do not mark everything you
  touch.
- **A message can come with items attached.** What the person had selected
  travels with their message as ids, in the comment's item references — so
  "make these two match" names its two. Read `comment.items` before you guess
  from the words; `isocan comment ls --json` has them.
- **A mark on an item is an instruction.** When someone scribbles on a screen
  and says "delete this and relayout", the ink is a real item: a drawing whose
  properties say what it is about.

  ```
  isocan show <ink> --json     # properties: annotates=<itemId>, region=x,y,w,h
  isocan get <item> out.html   # read the thing being marked up
  ```

  `region` is the marked area in FRACTIONS of the target — "0.52,0.10,0.43,0.40"
  is the right-hand block of its upper half — so you can act on where they
  pointed without parsing the SVG. `isocan get <ink>` if you want to see the
  marks themselves. The comment that came with it carries the ink in its item
  references, and the thread is anchored to the TARGET, so `isocan wait --item
  <target>` hears it.

  A drawing titled **Markup** is the same thing made deliberately: the person
  opened the screen in a markup window, drew arrows, boxes and circles about
  it, and landed all of them as ONE item — so expect several marks in one SVG,
  and one `region` that covers the lot. Read it, act, `rm` it like any mark.
  To attach a markup (or any item) to a comment of your own without spelling
  it in the words: `isocan comment add "…" --item <screen> --about <markup>`,
  or `--about` on `comment reply`. The anchor rides along in `items` too, as
  it does when the app's composer attaches a markup — so `items` reads
  `[screen, markup]` whichever surface posted it.
- **Clear a mark once you have acted on it; leave a drawing alone.** Ink that
  annotates an item asked for something — when the new version answers it,
  `isocan rm <ink>` and say so in your reply, or the screen keeps wearing an X
  through the change it asked for. Ink on bare canvas asked for nothing: it is
  someone's drawing, and it is not yours to tidy.
- **One note that changes, not four that pile up.** When work will take more
  than a moment, post ONE comment and rewrite it as you go:

  ```
  isocan comment reply <thread> "On it — reading the spec" --json   # → commentId
  isocan comment edit <thread> <comment> "On it — found the mismatch in the calendar"
  isocan comment edit <thread> <comment> "Done — spec now matches tracker v3"
  ```

  A thread that reads "on it" / "still on it" / "found it" / "done" is four
  comments where one would do, and the human reads every one of them. Only the
  author may edit a comment — the daemon refuses otherwise — and `comment add`
  and `comment reply` both hand back the id with `--json`.

  Do NOT write how long you took: the canvas already knows. It shows
  "edited · 4m" from the comment's own timestamps, which is measured rather
  than claimed. Say what you did and what you decided; the clock is not yours
  to report.
- **Watch one thing, not everything.** A plain `wait` wakes on comments for
  you. `--all-ops` wakes on every change anyone makes, which costs you a turn
  each time to decide you did not care. Say what you are watching instead:

  ```
  isocan wait --item <ref> --op item.addVersion --json --timeout 900
  ```

  `--item` takes any item ref (repeatable), `--op` takes a type or a family
  (`item.*`), and `--in <area>` narrows to what happens inside an area — an
  item whose centre is there, or a thread pinned there — which is how an agent
  working in one lane of a board parks on that lane alone
  (`isocan wait --in "Sketches" --json --timeout 900`). A summons still wakes you through any filter — being told to stop
  is never the noise you asked to be spared — and the JSON says which it was:
  `reason: "summons"` or `"change"`. Your own ops never wake you, so writing
  the thing you were watching for does not wake you again.

  This is how you keep a spec in step with what it describes: park on the item,
  wake when it gains a version, rewrite the spec, park again.
- **Wear your color.** `isocan identity --color teal` (or any of crimson,
  violet, amber, forest, periwinkle, graphite, a `#hex`, or `none`) sets the
  color your cursor, face, and pins wear for everyone, on every canvas.
  `isocan identity --mark 🦊` puts an emoji on your face, and everyone else
  sees your pointer wear it instead of the arrow.
- **Verify before you ship.** HTML items: test logic headlessly (extract the
  script, run in node with DOM stubs). Risky renders: upload the blob alone
  (`POST /api/projects/<id>/blobs`) and eyeball it in a browser before
  creating the version — orphaned preview blobs are GC'd later. Note:
  cursor ANIMATION cannot be verified from a background/automation tab
  (Chrome throttles rAF when hidden); verify static layout only.
- **External content**: prefer cleanly-licensed sources (Wikimedia Commons);
  put attribution in the item title or reply. Say what you skipped and why.
- **Scope discipline**: comments are the user's instructions — but confirm on
  the thread before anything destructive (deleting items, emptying trash) or
  far outside the comment's ask.
- **Undo is per-actor**: your `isocan undo` only reverts your own ops.
- **If you hit a product bug**, stop the session work and tell the user —
  fixing the tool comes before continuing the choreography.

<!-- topic: items | making and arranging things — `add`, text nodes, Google Docs, canvases on canvases, groups, copying, files on disk, a live React component -->

## Adding anything: one verb that reads what you give it

`isocan add <thing>` is the one door. It reads the thing the way the app's
Add popover reads what is pasted into its one field: a path on disk is a
**file**, a Google Doc address is a **document** (the export, with its ↗),
a canvas address — or a canvas id or title prefix among the canvases this
machine knows — is a **canvas card**, and any other address is a **site**.
`--as file|site|doc|canvas` says which you meant when the reading could go
two ways (a title that is also a word, a file whose name looks like an
address). `browse <url>`, `gdoc add <url>` and `canvas place <ref>` are the
older spellings of the same acts, with the kind already said; all of them take `--at`, `--in`,
`--cell` and `--size` alike, and land where there is room in view when you
say nothing.

```
isocan add ./deck.pdf                                  # a file
isocan add https://docs.google.com/document/d/<id>/edit  # a document
isocan add "Sports schedule"                           # a canvas card, by title
isocan add https://example.com/status --as site        # a site, said plainly
isocan add design.md --visual design-system.html       # dual-face: source + visual
```

When an artifact has two faces — a source face for editing in the workbench and a
distinct visual face for rendering in iframes and presentations (such as an interactive
companion visualizer for a markdown doc) — pass `--visual <file>`. For HTML files
with local image assets, `isocan add` handles this automatically: images are inlined
into the visual face while leaving the clean source face intact for disk backing.

## Words on the canvas

`isocan text "…"` puts words down as a **text node**: no card, no filename on
its face, editable by anyone who clicks it. Use it for the things that are
about the canvas rather than on it — a heading over a row of screens, a
caveat beside a mock, the question you want answered next to the thing it is
about.

It is an ordinary markdown item underneath, so nothing is special-cased: it
versions when edited, `#Title` points at it, `isocan get` hands back a `.md`,
and if it turns out to belong in the repo, `set --file` and `save` write it
there like anything else.

Prefer it over a comment when the words should be VISIBLE on the canvas
rather than folded into a pin — a label is not a conversation. Prefer a
comment when you are talking TO somebody.

The human has the same tool: `T`, then click the canvas and type. So a heading
you put down can be re-worded by them without asking you, and one they put
down is yours to read with `isocan get`. Double-clicking a node re-opens its
words, which lands as a new version like every other edit.

**Size is how far out it stays readable, not decoration.** A text node's size
is in world units, so it shrinks with the canvas: default text is a grey
smear by 25% zoom, and below 5 screen pixels the canvas stops drawing it at
all and shows a `T` mark instead. The ladder doubles, so each step survives
twice as far out:

| `--style` | readable to |
|---|---|
| `body` (default) | 50% |
| `heading` | 25% |
| `title` | 12% |
| `display` | 6% |

So label a CLUSTER with `--style title` and it is still legible in the
whole-board view where the notes beside it have become marks. That is the
whole point of having both — put the orientation in the big text.

`--face sans|mono|serif|hand` picks the voice. Reach for `mono` when the
words are a command or a path, which yours often are, and `hand` when you
are scribbling on the board rather than labelling it.

`--color red|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple|pink|brown|grey` colours the
words. A NAME adapts: each has a shade chosen for the light ground, the dark
ground and paper, so it reads for a collaborator in either theme — prefer
names. `--color '#rrggbb'` is drawn exactly, and the CLI warns (and sets it
anyway) where it will not reach 4.5:1. `auto`, or no flag, is the theme's own
ink; there is no black or white, because neither reads in both themes.

`--font <name>` names a family from a closed list — Inter, IBM Plex Sans,
DM Sans, Manrope, Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Serif, Fraunces, Lora, IBM Plex
Mono, JetBrains Mono. A font brings its face (`Lora` is a serif), which is
also what shows offline or before the file arrives, and the box is sized for
the family's real width. `none` returns to the plain face.

Changing a node later keeps its words whole: `isocan set <item> --prop
textStyle=title` (or `textFace=…`, `textColor=blue`, `textFont=Fraunces`,
read with the same words as the flags) and `isocan edit <item> words.md` grow the
box to hold the words at the new look, and `isocan fit <item>` re-fits a
caption to its words from scratch — the repair for one that was left a line
short. `--size` still wins when you give it.

A markdown heading inside a node scales with it: `#` is drawn at one and a
half times the node's step (`##` and `###` a little less, never smaller than
the words), so a `--style display` node's heading is bigger than the paragraph
under it, and the box is sized to hold it.

Markdown lines start with `-` and so do options, so a bullet given as an
argument needs `--` first. For anything with more than one line in it, pipe it:

```sh
printf '## Standup\n\n- text tool landed\n- park bug fixed\n' | isocan text -f -
```

## A Google Doc on the canvas

`isocan add <url>` with a Google Doc's address puts it here as a **document**: its markdown
export is the item's content — readable, searchable, thumbed in the lens,
versioned, context an agent reads — and the doc's address is its `source`,
the ↗ on its strip. In the app the strip also has *Live*: the doc as Google
draws it right now, framed in place of the words, a mode each person flips
for themselves; the words stay the record you read. `synced` says when the words were taken. `isocan gdoc sync`
re-exports every doc item on the canvas (`--in <sheet>` for one shelf) and
lands a new version only where the document changed. A doc shared by link
needs nothing; for one that is not, `isocan gdoc auth --token <token>` saves
a Drive access token on this machine (mode 600, never on a canvas; Google's
last about an hour — `gcloud auth print-access-token | isocan gdoc auth
--stdin` refreshes it), and `add`, `gdoc sync` and the app's Add
popover through this daemon use it only where the anonymous export refused.
With a token, `sync` asks Drive when each doc last moved and leaves the
unchanged ones unread. The words are on the canvas once added — everyone
admitted can read them — so say so before adding somebody's private
document.

## A canvas on a canvas

`isocan canvas place <ref|address>` puts another canvas on this one as an
ordinary item: a card that draws the other canvas small and live, opens it in
a new tab on a double-click or its ↗, and wears `kind=canvas`, `canvas=<id>`
and `source=<address>` so you can read which canvas it is without opening
it. A canvas is a place you go, not a thing you step inside of; a card is
never entered. It takes `--in <group>` like everything else, which is how a
person's canvases are shelved onto sheets. `isocan ls --kind canvas` lists
them. A canvas will not be placed on itself. `--inherit` makes the card a
memory link as it lands — the other canvas's design system and pins join this
canvas's context (see *Saying what matters here*).

The card draws the other canvas LIVE for anyone admitted to it. For the
reader who is not — or a tab that is offline, or a canvas at another home —
`isocan canvas shot <ref> --into <item>` takes a real screenshot through the
same headless browser the graders run and lands it as a version of the card,
which shows it under the words when its own pull is refused. Needs the
repository checkout and Chrome; a nightly is the right place for it.

## Groups: explicit membership, with area aliases

New canvases have groups. A group owns its direct members: moving it carries
its descendants and attached ink; resizing it scales their frames. Overlap
alone never adds an item. Removing a member preserves its world position,
and ungrouping removes the frame while preserving its children.

```sh
isocan canvas group new "Sketches" --note "Sketch alone; hand in at the bell."
isocan canvas group ls
isocan text "Acme first sketch" --in Sketches
isocan add sketch.html --in Sketches
isocan mv <item> --in Sketches
isocan mv <item> --out                     # one level up; --to-root for the canvas
isocan ls --in Sketches                    # direct members; --recursive expands
isocan tidy --in Sketches
isocan canvas group grid Sketches 2x3 --rows "Draft,Review"
isocan text "Acme review" --in Sketches --cell 2,1
isocan canvas group grid Sketches --clear
isocan canvas group stack Sketches         # a pile of cards; --spread puts it back
```

`canvas group stack` shows a group as a pile — one card on top, the rest
turned behind it — for everyone, until `--spread`. It only changes the
drawing: every member keeps its x/y, `ls`, `mv`, `add --in` and `show` work
as before (`show` says `stacked`), and placing into a stacked group places in
spread space, so spreading shows it where it was put.

`area new`, `area ls` and `area grid` are compatibility spellings for these
canvas-group acts; `area new --tint yellow` also sets the frame's tint. All
structural aliases support `--dry-run` and `--json`. Group IDs and title
prefixes must identify exactly one group. `slides add --in Storyboard`
reads explicit descendants in reading order.

Existing legacy canvases keep their recorded geometry until you convert them.
`area ls` labels that legacy read; `area new/grid` instead explain how to migrate.
Preview before applying:

```sh
isocan canvas group migrate --dry-run --json
isocan canvas group migrate --revision <preview-revision>
```

The writer's preview names membership choices, overlapping-area ambiguity,
label/grid repairs, dangling annotations, legacy trash and the undo boundary.
Apply uses that exact revision and refuses a stale preview without changing
anything. `canvas group migrate` without `--revision` fetches a fresh preview
and applies its revision in one operation. Repeating conversion is a no-op.
Older timeline history remains readable. While converted, ordinary Undo/Redo
cannot cross the boundary into old area operations. Immediate migration undo
restores the prior legacy structure, but later group-dependent live, trash or
redo state can block it; undoing visible work alone may not be enough. Nothing
purges trash or discards history to make rollback pass. Queued writes retain
their originating mode and a cutover refusal remains visible for reconciliation.
Full native export/import preserves mode, boundary and history.

`canvas new <title>` uses the writer's group default. `--legacy` is for
intentional compatibility fixtures; it does not opt out of migration rules.
`canvas new <title> --space <name-or-id>` is born in that space with no link
grant; access comes from the space. The acting person must own the space.
Omitting `--space` keeps the usual canvas birth. `space ls` shows the names
and ids, and an ambiguous name must be given by id.
Top-level `group` continues to manage people and sharing; an undo-group label
continues to join log entries for undo. Neither establishes canvas membership.

## Groups: every verb and flag

**Canvas membership (new canvases use groups):** `canvas group new <title> [--at x,y] [--size WxH] [--note text]`,
`canvas group wrap <items...> --title <title> [--note text]`,
`canvas group ls`, `canvas group show <group> [--recursive]`,
`canvas group add <group> <items...> [--place] [--cell r,c]`,
`canvas group remove <items...> [--to-root]`, and
`canvas group ungroup <groups...>`, `canvas group resize <group> WxH [--anchor nw|ne|sw|se]`,
`canvas group frame <groups...> --fit` (or one group with `--size WxH`/`--at x,y`),
`canvas group layout <group> [--title-height n] [--brief-height n] [--inset n] [--row-gutter n] [--column-gutter n] [--tidy]`,
`canvas group grid <group> [RxC] [--rows names] [--cols names] [--tidy] [--clear]`,
`canvas group stack <group> [--spread]`,
and `canvas group migrate [--dry-run] [--revision n]`.
`area new <title>`, `area ls` and `area grid <group> [RxC] [--clear]` are compatibility aliases; `area ls` can also read legacy areas.
Grid labels are comma-separated; cells count from 1. Lowering a count drops the saved labels past it in the same write (the web's layout form does the same), and more names than cells is refused; members of a cell that goes away keep their places. Every mutation accepts `--dry-run`:
it validates through the shared resolver and reports affected roots, parent
changes, final boxes and frame adjustments without uploading note bytes or
writing an operation. Every command supports `--json`. IDs are exact; title
and ID prefixes must be unique, and ambiguities list candidates.

Wrapping preserves the arrangement and keeps nested groups intact. Add
preserves positions and fits the destination frame; `--place` finds room
below its current members. `mv <item> --in <group> [--cell r,c] [--dry-run]` uses that same
atomic add-and-place operation, and `mv <item> --out [--to-root] [--dry-run]` is
its twin, the same act as `group remove`: out to the group's parent, or with
`--to-root` straight to the canvas, without moving. (A person does it by
⌘-dragging the item off its frame, or ⌘⇧G on it, or *Move to canvas*.) Remove promotes each item to its group's
parent, or directly to the canvas with `--to-root`; it preserves geometry.
Ungroup trashes the frames and preserves their children. These are single
undoable acts, including required ancestor frame changes. An overlapping
item is not a member. `show --recursive --json` lists every descendant;
ordinary `show` lists direct members and reports direct/total counts, parent,
outer/content boxes and layout settings.

On group canvases, `mv` and `set --size` transform descendants and attached ink once.
The resize anchor names the fixed corner; `nw` is the default. **Fit frame**
changes the group's border around the arrangement without scaling members.
`fit`, `align`, `distribute` and `tidy` share the same placement-unit semantics
and accept `--dry-run`; group-plus-child selections do not move a child twice.
`tidy --in <group>` arranges direct members inside the saved label reservations.
`ls --in <group>` reads direct membership; add `--recursive` for descendants.

`add`, `text`, `canvas place`, `map new` and `sticker drop`
accept `--in <group>` and `--cell r,c`. A named cell either holds the whole
placement unit or the request refuses. `--at` with `--in` retains the explicit
parent and requests exact world placement. The writer creates the item and
repairs containing frames in one operation; CLI output reports its final box.
New annotated drawings inherit their target's group automatically. New sandbox
transcripts inherit the program's group; later versions retain the transcript's
own parent, even after it has been moved elsewhere.

Attached ink follows its target's membership. To remove the ink independently,
first use `set <ink> --rm-prop annotates --rm-prop region` to detach its
annotation relationship in one undoable operation, then remove it from the
group. In the browser, use **Detach from annotated item**, then **Remove from
group**. Enter a group to edit its direct children; Escape returns to its
parent. **Group selection** is ⌘/Ctrl+G, **Ungroup** is ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+G, and
Shift+F10 or the Menu key opens the selection menu.

New canvases use groups. Legacy canvases offer `canvas group migrate --dry-run`
before any group creation; `area ls` still reads the old geometry. Grid cells
and migration are available through the commands above. Top-level `group new|ls|add|remove|rm`
still manages people and access. `session select` still shares quoted text.

## Copying things, and taking them to another canvas

`isocan copy <items...>` puts a copy beside the originals; `--to <canvas>`
puts it on a different one. The human does the same with ⌘C/⌘V, and both
write the same ops.

Two things it does that a loop over `add` would not. **The arrangement of a
selection is kept** — four screens in a row copy as four screens in a row,
because the group is placed as one box rather than each item being placed on
its own. And **a copy records what it was made from** (`parent`), so
`isocan lineage` shows it hanging off its original — except across canvases,
where that id would point at nothing.

On group destinations, one copy is one operation and one undo: a
group carries its full subtree and attached ink, selected group+child roots
are deduplicated, and deliberate internal overlaps survive. Only current
versions are copied, including distinct visual bytes. Every required face is
checked before the write; a missing member or failed upload refuses the whole
copy. `--dry-run` validates without uploading or writing. `--in` names an
explicit destination group; omission puts copied roots on the canvas. Copying
only a child does not copy its old container. Internal module relationships
are remapped; external references are dropped across canvases.

`export --item <group>` backs up the complete subtree, all saved versions and
both faces into the existing item-backup directories. Item backups are not an
import format. Use a full native `export` and `import` to restore a canvas and
its frozen request provenance. JSON Canvas remains export-only.

A copy does NOT inherit the original's `file`. Two items claiming one path
would overwrite each other on `save`, and the copy is not that file — bind it
yourself if it should be one.

## Screens that become files

Most of what you make on a canvas should stay on the canvas. Somebody asks to
see a view, you build it, they look at it — it never needed to be a file, and
making it one leaves litter in a repo somebody else has to clean up.

Some of it should not. A screen that is a new part of the system somebody is
building wants to be a file in their tree, where their editor, their build and
their git can all reach it. **That is your call to make, per item, and it is
two steps on purpose:**

```sh
isocan set <item> --file src/views/start.html   # where it belongs
isocan save <item>                              # take it there
```

The first is a canvas fact — it replicates, it travels to a teammate who
clones the repo, and it costs nothing if the file is never written. The second
touches a real filesystem, and only ever on the machine the canvas lives on.
`--file ''` takes the backing off again; the item stays exactly where it is.
If the item also has a visual face, `isocan set <item> --visual-file <path>`
records its backing path, and `isocan save` writes both files to disk.

**Ask before you back something.** A path in somebody's repo is theirs, not
the canvas's, and "I made you a file" is a surprise nobody asked for. Backing
a screen you were asked to build for a real project is ordinary; backing every
sketch you run up is noise.

**What the daemon will refuse, so you can say why:** a path outside the bound
directory, a dotfile or a secret-shaped name at any segment, anything reached
through a symlink — and a file that does not match the item's current version.

**That last refusal has two causes and they need different answers.** Either
somebody edited the file outside the canvas — their work is under your write,
and `--force` would eat it, so ask first — or the CANVAS moved and the disk is
simply behind, which is what `version promote` does every time. Check which
before you reach for `--force`: `isocan version ls <item>` shows the stack with
`▶` on the current one, and if that mark is not on the newest version, the
file in the tree is stale rather than precious. Saying "your file changed" to
somebody who only promoted a version is a confusing thing to be told.

**The file on disk is not the item.** `isocan get <item>` hands back the
version the stack points at — the PROMOTED one, which is **not necessarily
the newest**. By default, `isocan get` outputs the source face (e.g. clean markdown
or un-inlined HTML); `isocan get <item> --visual` outputs the visual face if one
is present. The file in the tree is only ever whatever was last written
there, and nothing writes it automatically: `save` and the app's save button
are the only two things that do. So the moment somebody promotes v9 of a
twelve-version item, `get` gives you v9 and the file still holds v12, and it
will keep holding v12 until somebody writes it out.

**Read with `isocan get`, not by opening the path.** A human who promotes a
version is telling you which one they want — that is the whole gesture — and
an agent that reads the file instead answers with the one they set aside,
then stacks a new version on top of it and buries the choice. If you do need
the path (an editor, a build, a test run), write it out first with `isocan
save <item>` so the two agree before you start.

## A live React component as a canvas item

An HTML item runs its own inline scripts, and the frame's content policy
lets scripts load from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` — so one self-contained
file can load React, ReactDOM and Babel from there and render JSX, with no
build and no server. Pin exact versions (React 18 is the last with UMD
builds):

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Acme counter</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18.3.1/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-dom@18.3.1/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@babel/standalone@7.26.4/babel.min.js"></script>
<style>body { font: 16px system-ui, sans-serif; margin: 24px; }</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="text/babel" data-presets="react">
function Counter({ label }) {
  const [n, setN] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setN(n + 1)}>
      {label}: {n}
    </button>
  );
}
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<Counter label="Acme orders" />);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

`isocan add counter.html --title "Acme counter"` puts it on the canvas;
a person double-clicks it to use it. To iterate, edit the file and run
`isocan edit <item> counter.html`: that is a new version, the frame reloads
with it, and the old one stays in the stack.

The limits are the frame's, not React's: nothing but jsdelivr loads (a
package is reachable only as a UMD or `+esm` build there, and nothing
fetches at runtime — no API calls); it is one file, so no local imports and
no bundler; and there is no hot reload — every edit is a fresh version with
fresh state.

<!-- topic: design | design work — requests and questions, the design system, images, variations, compare, review and repair -->

## Design requests, questions and the design system

The practices that belong to design work in particular — how a request is
entered, how its questions are asked, and what reading the design system
before a screen means.

- **One design request, through either entrance.** Read `isocan design
  workflow` for the procedure and canvas-owned automatic enrollment policy.
  `isocan design brief [request] --json` returns canonical briefs, exact
  references, source provenance, question history, remaining allowance,
  lifecycle capabilities, and receipts with current/stale/unavailable reasons.
  `--thread <id> --comment <id>` finds a canvas request; `--output <item>` finds
  the request beside its result. Ordinary uploaded JSON is not admission.

  For an external request, save this synthetic starting intent as `request.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "requestId": "req_acme_receiving",
    "itemId": "itm_acme_receiving_brief",
    "versionId": "ver_acme_receiving_start",
    "source": { "entrance": "external-agent", "externalRequestId": "acme-receiving-1" },
    "fields": {
      "intent": "create", "fidelity": "designed", "delivery": "html-node",
      "targetItemId": null, "groupId": null,
      "audience": "Warehouse staff", "primaryTask": "Receive stock on a phone",
      "constraints": ["Use the existing brand"], "facts": [], "references": [],
      "outstandingDecisionIds": [], "outputIds": []
    }
  }
  ```

  For canvas chat, replace `source` with `{ "entrance": "canvas-chat",
  "threadId": "<actual thread>", "commentId": "<actual request comment>" }`.
  The home resolves the original author and captured context. External supplied
  facts are attributed to the reporting agent; do not imitate a human answer.

  ```sh
  isocan design start request.json --json
  isocan design workflow req_acme_receiving
  isocan design brief req_acme_receiving --json > brief-read.json
  ```

  An explicit start works while automatic enrollment is off. `design start
  request.json --automatic` requires `design.workflow=adaptive-v1`; unknown
  policy stays unsupported. Keep the file and all IDs for retry. The default
  operation ID hashes the complete `versionId` into a bounded stable ID;
  `--op-id` can supply an explicit one.

  To correct facts, save a lifecycle file with `brief` copied from the read's
  exact `ref`, the current `epoch`, a new stable `versionId`, and `patch`:

  ```sh
  node --input-type=module -e 'import fs from "node:fs"; const r=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("brief-read.json","utf8")).requests[0]; fs.writeFileSync("update.json",JSON.stringify({brief:r.ref,epoch:r.brief.epoch,versionId:"ver_acme_receiving_update",patch:{constraints:["Use the existing brand","Large controls"]}},null,2));'
  isocan design brief req_acme_receiving --update update.json --json
  ```

  `design brief --resume resume.json` uses the same captured basis plus a
  required `reason`; it advances epoch and preserves original source/facts.
  `--cancel cancel.json` needs the basis and new version ID, with optional reason.
  `--complete complete.json` accepts an output-bearing patch. Options are
  mutually exclusive. A stale refusal leaves your file intact: re-read and
  reconcile before preparing another version. Complete the brief before
  publishing a receipt bound to its exact completed reference.

  For settled design answers, the read's `reconciliation` contains the exact
  effective question/response bindings. Copy these as `acceptedResponses` in
  one update with your deliberate field patch. Review skipped, dismissed and
  delegated outcomes as such; they are not supplied preferences. Ordinary
  brief corrections preserve settled answers for this continuation.

  `design receipt [request] --publish receipt.json` takes
  `{itemId,versionId,receipt}`. The receipt names request/epoch, completed
  `brief`, actual canvas output or repository revision/build/runtime,
  `governing` selection, relevant `context`, fidelity, draft/ready status,
  checks and unresolved limits. Browser checks include actual tool/version,
  viewport, state, coverage and exact evidence references. The shared procedure
  explains what to exercise; without a browser, publish a draft. Reading
  `design receipt [request]` preserves reported results separately from their
  currentness and names runtime observations that this read cannot recheck.
  Use the selected canvas output's `outputGovernings` binding and the brief's
  live `contextReferences`; historical citations stay exact evidence, not
  implicit latest-version requirements. `design receipt --help` lists the
  publication fields and no-browser draft shape.

  Save an exact input/evidence `DesignArtifactRef` from the read as `ref.json`,
  then use `design brief <request> --reference ref.json --out reference.svg`.
  `--face visual` opens the retained visual face; `--out` refuses overwrite.
  Without `--out`, output is a bounded base64 page with offset/nextOffset.
  Foreign references retain permission checks at their original source.
- **Ask design questions with an identified source and respondent.**
  `isocan design questions --json` returns structured question sets, their exact
  thread/comment/payload revision, effective resolutions, response IDs and
  outstanding question IDs. `isocan design questions --respondents --json`
  lists writer-resolved human, agent and unknown identities. Only a named,
  known human can answer; being absent from an agent list is not eligibility.

  This publishing path needs an existing thread and a valid versioned brief.
  `isocan design start request.json` admits the ordinary request; `isocan design
  brief --json` returns its exact current reference, request ID and epoch.
  Existing unadmitted phase-1 briefs remain usable for manual questionnaires,
  but an uploaded JSON file does not acquire canonical request standing. The
  browser uses the same brief and respondent. Automatic enrollment remains a
  separate canvas policy; publishing questions does not turn it on.

  Save a `DesignQuestionSet` as JSON, with a stable `id`, `revision`, `brief`,
  `respondentActorId`, `headline`, `inferredAnswers`, `supersedes`, and `questions`,
  plus `schemaVersion: 1`, `kind: "questions"`, `requestId` and `epoch`.
  Every question needs `id`, `title`, `consequence`, `renderer`, `options`,
  `multiple`, `skippable` and `delegatable`. Choice options have `id`, `title`
  and `consequence`; visual cards additionally name actual versioned `preview`
  artifacts. Freeform, upload and URL questions have an empty options array.
  The supported renderers are `choice-list`, `visual-cards`, `freeform`, `upload`
  and `url-collection`. A normal first pass asks zero to three useful questions;
  an explicitly requested interview may contain up to 32.

  An admitted request also supplies `discovery`: `purpose` is `initial`,
  `consequential` or `interview`, with `factBindings` entries naming `questionId`
  and stable `factId`. Follow-up requires a new `reason`; interview also names
  its requesting `source`. Use `design workflow` for the remaining allowance.

  With `questions.json` prepared from that existing brief and thread:

  ```sh
  isocan design ask questions.json --thread thr_acme --json
  isocan design questions qset_acme --json
  # Run an answer as the named person, using their own claimed identity:
  isocan design answer qset_acme --id answer_acme --question workflow --option batch --json
  # Other forms: --text "...", --skip, --dismiss, --delegate usr_agent,
  # or --references references.json. Use exactly one answer form per command.
  isocan design answer --file saved-response.json --json
  isocan design reference thr_acme cmt_answer ref_sketch --out sketch.svg --json
  ```

  `--file` accepts the full saved `DesignResponse`: its exact `question` source,
  respondent, request/epoch and explicit `resolutions`. Use it for multiple
  questions in one answer. A `--supersedes` replacement must explicitly retain
  every question the earlier answer resolved. Skipping, dismissal and delegation
  are outcomes, not supplied facts. An agent must never answer by borrowing the
  person's identity.

  Upload the real file with `add` before referencing it. A references file is
  an array such as `{ "id": "ref_sketch", "state": "fetched", "artifact":
  { "home": "https://example.test", "canvasId": "prj_acme", "itemId":
  "itm_sketch", "versionId": "ver_sketch", "blobHash": "<actual SHA-256>" } }`.
  Replace the example identities with the uploaded version's real values.
  Every reference ID in an answer should be distinct. Two versions of the same
  item may be attached and read separately. A URL alone is `supplied`; an
  `inaccessible` URL needs a reason. Neither claims inspected content. This
  publishing path accepts local-canvas artifacts; copy remote references through
  the existing authorized canvas path first. `design reference` opens the exact
  retained bytes, even after a later edit; `--out` refuses to overwrite a file.
  Without `--out`, the command returns a bounded UTF-8 or base64 page with an
  optional `nextOffset`, so an image cannot flood the transcript.

  Preserve the payload ID and saved content when retrying. CLI derives stable
  operation/comment IDs and reports them with `accepted`, `pending` or `refused`.
  A lost receipt can be confirmed by the exact saved comment; otherwise keep
  the same intent until reconciled. `submittedOpId` retains the retry identity;
  `opId` is the actual accepted operation, or null when only the saved comment
  confirms delivery. `confirmedBy` distinguishes receipt from snapshot evidence.
  Joined identities are compared through the home's current join map while
  original answer authorship remains unchanged. Changing content under an old ID is a
  conflict. One `undo` removes the answer and reopens its questions; `redo`
  restores the original author and references.

  A legacy JSON `/ask` remains readable, but another participant's next comment
  is not its typed answer. Explicit adoption uses a file containing
  `{threadId, questions, legacySource: {threadId, commentId, body}}`: name the
  current brief and respondent, preserve the original body and equivalent
  normalized questions. The original comment stays in history. Malformed legacy
  content remains prose and cannot be adopted into an invented questionnaire.
- **Read the design system before you build a screen.** `isocan design` prints
  it: a DESIGN.md (github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) whose front matter
  carries typed tokens and whose sections carry the reasoning. It is an ITEM on
  the canvas, so it versions and both surfaces can see it — not a dotfile
  nobody updates.

  Two flags save you from retyping values into a screen and getting one wrong:
  `isocan design --css` gives you custom properties to paste, and `isocan design
  --tokens` gives you W3C design tokens for anything downstream (Figma, Style
  Dictionary, a Tailwind theme) — DTCG 2025.10, validated against the official
  schema: colours as sRGB objects, dimensions as `{value, unit}`, typography
  typed on the leaf. What the format cannot say (components, an `oklch()`
  colour, a `clamp()` size) rides in `$extensions["io.isocan"]` with the
  reason rather than being dropped, and a composite field the file never
  stated is filled with CSS's initial value and says so in `$description`.
  `isocan design import <tokens.json>` reads the same shape back, including
  the reference exporter's files. Build against the variables rather than the
  literals; a screen full of hex codes is a screen that cannot follow the
  system when it changes.

  `isocan design check` says whether the system itself holds up — references to
  tokens nobody kept, values that are not colours, contrast that fails. Run it
  before you grade a screen against it, and before you hand a system back.

  One token is isocan's addition to the format: `surface: flat | raised |
  glass | bold` — how the system's surfaces are drawn (elevation shadows,
  frosted translucent panes, thick-bordered hard shadows). Optional; absent
  or unknown reads as `flat`, and `design check` warns on a value it does not
  know. Wireframes draw it (`isocan wire style`).

  **A design system can govern one group rather than the canvas.** A DESIGN.md
  that belongs to a group governs its direct and nested members — three lanes
  can hold three philosophies while the canvas keeps its own. Add
  `--in <group>` to `isocan design`, `check`, `set`, `import` and `audit`
  (`isocan design --css --in "Road Signs"`); a screen you add is scored against
  the system that governs its membership. The order is the nearest group,
  its ancestors, then the canvas and a linked canvas's. Legacy canvases retain
  their geometric area scope.

  **A DESIGN.md already on the canvas can be chosen in place:** `isocan design
  use <item>` makes it the system of wherever it sits — the canvas at the
  root, its group inside one. If that scope already has a system, the item's
  words land as a new VERSION of it (the op `design set` sends for the same
  bytes); if not, the item itself becomes the system. `--off` stops one
  governing and leaves the item. One op either way, so `isocan undo` takes it
  back. People do the same from the item's right-click menu — "Use as design
  system" (or "Use as this group's design system" inside a group) on a
  DESIGN.md, and "Stop using as design system" on one that governs — and both surfaces
  send the same op. `design set`, `import` and `use` then print a `note:` on
  stderr saying what the system governs now, which groups keep their own, and
  which one wins when two sit at one level — the same sentence `mv --in` and
  `canvas group add/remove` print when a move changes it.

  `isocan design audit` parses screen styling and reports departures from each
  screen's governing system: colours, type sizes, radii and declared spacing.
  Findings include original source locations, missing references and candidate
  token repairs. External styles, dynamic expressions and ambiguous CSS remain
  visibly unexamined; matching literals are allowed unless the governing
  contract requires references. `--json` includes screen
  item/version/blob identity, governing item/version/source canvas, rule version,
  diagnostics and coverage, alongside the existing `system`, `screens`,
  `offSystem`, `items` and per-screen `onSystem`/`offSystem` fields. An unavailable
  item has a reason instead of a fabricated clean score. Ordinary auditing is
  advisory and does not change content. HTML `add` and `edit` return an `audit`
  evidence field even under `--json`; a failed later audit reports unavailable
  while the successful stored version remains successful.
  A DESIGN.md names expected values; it does not inject CSS into a screen.
  Token-reference repairs may require including the exported declarations in
  the artifact. Read each candidate's prerequisites before applying it.

  Each report exposes `policy`: the effective contract, original `isocan`
  extension, unsupported rules and applied treatments/exceptions with reasons.
  A governing DESIGN.md may declare `isocan.lint.version: 1` and
  `literals: require-references`, plus recipes with `owns`, `allow` and
  `treatments` maps, and reasoned exceptions. HTML opts in explicitly with
  `data-isocan-recipe="Button"`, `data-isocan-treatment="compact"` or
  `data-isocan-exception="hero-spacing"`. Generic class names grant nothing.
  Version 1 checks owned padding, physical border radii, font size and weight;
  its report states the supported selector/cascade boundary. Exceptions relax
  only their named ownership/reference checks; off-scale values still fail.
  Unsupported contracts remain visible with incomplete coverage.

  The nearest governing document supplies the whole contract; lane policies
  do not merge. Change that document through its ordinary editor or
  `isocan design set DESIGN.md --in <group>`, then refresh the audit.
  `isocan undo` restores its prior version. HTML repair changes only the screen.
  Native DESIGN.md and DTCG `--tokens` exports preserve extension data;
  `--css` exports token values and carries a note that contracts are omitted.
  `design import --dry-run --json` includes conversion `notes` and `problems`.

  Select a screen with `isocan design audit --item <item>`. Check a file without
  saving it with `isocan design audit --file screen.html --item <item>` or
  `--in <group>` for that scope's context. For entirely local checking, use
  `isocan design audit --file screen.html --design DESIGN.md`; this needs no
  canvas or identity. File and editor-draft reports identify the actual input
  hash, separately from stored versions. `--fail` opts into exit 2 for findings,
  incomplete/unavailable coverage, omitted token categories or no checked values;
  command and file-read errors exit 1. An ordinary audit stays advisory.

  An explicit repair carries the version and governing source you reviewed:

  ```sh
  isocan design audit --item itm_acme --json > audit.json
  # Write the replacement HTML, retaining the task's content and behavior.
  isocan design repair itm_acme repaired.html --from-audit audit.json --json
  ```

  The repair refreshes the system before committing one conditional `item.edit`.
  Stale screen, governing source or rule versions are refused; read a fresh
  report before deciding again. Its result contains `before`, `proposed` and
  post-save `after` evidence. `status: pending` (exit 3) means acceptance is
  unconfirmed: keep the draft and inspect the reported version before retrying.
  `status: saved` remains saved if its later audit is unavailable. A changed
  system or newer screen discovered after saving is explicitly reported. One
  `isocan undo` restores the prior version. Ordinary `edit` still appends a
  version; the explicit repair is the action with the captured-version fence.

  Limit an agent's correction loop to **two repair rounds**, refreshing the
  report after each. Then render and review the screen's intent and interactions;
  lint compliance alone does not approve the design. Never add tokens or weaken
  a governing policy merely to clear a finding.

  For an optional Tailwind v4 repository audit, run from an isocan source
  checkout:

  ```sh
  node scripts/design-lint-repo.mjs --repo /path/to/project --json -- src/example.tsx
  ```

  This standalone script uses the target repository's existing ESLint config
  and dependencies, with no installs or fixes. Its advisory report includes
  explicit incomplete coverage; zero findings does not establish compliance
  with a DESIGN.md policy. See the
  [optional-tool research](../../../docs/research/2026-09-14-optional-project-linters.md)
  for measured compatibility, limits and conditional recommendations.

  The source checkout's standalone repair-evaluation harness uses a fresh
  output directory:

  ```sh
  node scripts/design-lint-eval.mjs --dry-run --out /tmp/acme-design-eval
  ```

  Its six fixtures and 36 canned runs exercise a real local daemon, Chrome and
  conditional repair with zero evaluation model calls. Dry runs establish no
  model lift or human ratings. Model mode needs a separately user-approved
  budget. Read the [evaluation plan](../../../docs/projects/design-lint/evaluation.md)
  and [measured results](../../../docs/research/2026-09-14-design-lint-evaluation.md).
  For the documented pilot's verified zero-token login refusal, model mode
  accepts `--continue-from <prior-output-directory>` and a fresh `--out`,
  retaining the original budget and invocation count with one claimed successor.
  The evaluation plan specifies this narrow continuation's eligibility.

  **Past six screens with no design system, `isocan add` refuses an HTML file.**
  Two screens gets you a note, because the second screen is where a choice
  becomes a convention. Six is where a note that has been ignored stops being
  worth printing. Write one, ask for `/design-system` to derive one from what is
  already there, or `isocan design skip` if this canvas genuinely does not want
  one — a canvas of historical pages has screens that are SUPPOSED to disagree.
  There is no flag: the decision belongs on the canvas where the next person
  can see it, not in whoever's shell history.

  Build to it, and say in your reply which parts of it you used. If it does
  not cover something you had to decide, say THAT too: the gaps are what the
  next version of the style should close. If the canvas has no design system,
  `/design-system` derives one from the screens already there — what they
  already do, rather than a system you invented and imposed.

  Designing from scratch each time is why a canvas ends up with six type
  scales and four blues, each screen fine on its own.
- **Know what a generated interface looks like, and stop doing it.** There is
  a short list of moves that machine-made design reaches for — the purple-to-
  blue hero, the italic serif headline, glassmorphism over nothing, three
  equal feature cards, "Get Started", one radius for every object, emoji as
  section markers. `/design-audit` checks a screen against the list and
  against the design system, from the SOURCE, and cites the line.

  It is a floor, not taste: clearing it makes a screen unembarrassing, not
  good. Good comes from the design system being specific and from the person
  rejecting drafts.

## Seeing what changed

`isocan diff <item>` says what the last edit did: the version before the one
showing against the one showing, as one sentence and a numbered list.
`isocan diff <item> v2 v5` compares any two (`vN`, `N`, an id or an id
prefix). `isocan diff <variation> --source` compares a variation with the
screen it was made from, which is the pair `choose` decides. `--json` is the
structured diff.

It reads the meaning of each kind rather than its bytes:

- **Text and Markdown**: lines, then the words inside a changed line.
- **HTML**: the parsed DOM, so an inserted card is one added element. It
  reports attribute, class, inline style and text changes, and stylesheet
  rules property by property, each with a node path.
- **Wireframes**: the embedded spec, so it reports "stacked list → data
  table", props, words, and intents. An intent is a link, since a wire's
  links are computed from intents.
- **Images**: metadata only, and it says so.

Use it before you tell a person what you changed, since it is what they will
see. Use it before you recommend a variation, too: "Pro is gone and the button
is primary" is a better reason to pick one than "it looks cleaner". A person
gets the same diff from **Compare versions** in the item menu or the version
fan. There, the changes are highlighted inside both renders and can be stepped
through. Diffing only reads the item and never writes to it.

## Choosing between variations

`isocan prefer <winner> --over <other>` says **I liked this one better**, and
that is all it says: nothing moves, nothing is trashed, no picture changes. It
is the cheap half, meant to happen twenty times — left, right, next pair — and
that is why it is separate from `choose` below, which is final.

Use it whenever a person tells you which of several they prefer, even in
passing, because until this existed nothing on a canvas knew what anybody
LIKED. The design system supplies coherence and `/design-audit` supplies a
floor; neither is taste. Twenty preferences are a question worth asking: what
do the winners have in common, and should the design system say it out loud?

Preferring the same pair twice is one fact and refuses rather than writing it
again; `--undo` takes one back. The record survives `choose` trashing the
loser, because the trash is a place rather than a deletion.

Then, when the exploration is over: `isocan choose <item>` says **this one
won**:
the winner's content becomes a new version of the screen it was made from, and
every sibling — the winner included — goes to the trash.

The winner goes too, and that is deliberate: its content now lives on the
source's stack, so leaving it would be two copies of one decision and an
invitation to edit the wrong one. Nothing is lost. `--dry-run` says what would
happen and does nothing. A person does the same from the app: right-click the
variation → **Choose this variation** sends exactly the ops `choose` sends, so
if somebody asks you to "keep this one", either door is the same decision.

**One undo takes the whole decision back**, because the version and the
deletions share a group. The version comes off the source and every child
comes out of the trash in one gesture. (`isocan undo` names one op when it
does this — it is terse rather than wrong; the whole gesture is undone.)

It refuses with a reason rather than a shrug: an item made from nothing has
nowhere to fold back into, and an item whose source has been deleted since
says so.

## Bringing in somebody else's theme

`isocan design import <file>` takes a stylesheet of custom properties — a
shadcn theme, a `:root` block out of devtools — or a W3C token JSON, and lands
it as this canvas's design system. `--dry-run` reads it and prints what it
would write without touching the canvas, which is how to check a theme before
committing to it.

It reads **every** block, not just `:root`, because a shadcn theme keeps its
dark palette in `.dark` and taking half a theme silently is the worst thing an
importer can do. It wraps a bare HSL triplet — `222.2 47.4% 11.2%`, which is
what shadcn actually ships — into a real colour, because a contrast checker
cannot do anything with three numbers.

**Whatever it cannot place, it names** on stderr rather than dropping. A
`--duration-fast: 150ms` has no home in a design system yet, and you should
know that rather than find out weeks later.

Importing over an existing system writes a NEW VERSION, never a replacement:
an import is exactly the moment somebody discovers they wanted the old one
back. Run `isocan design check` afterwards — what it flags is usually not an
import error but the part of a design system that lives in a house's head
rather than in its stylesheet, and those are the first things worth writing
down.

## Making an image

Several commands ask for pictures — an app icon, a marketing screenshot, a
social card. You almost certainly have no image model, and for most of this
work that is not the handicap it sounds like. Three ways, in the order to try
them:

**1. Author it.** Write the asset as SVG or HTML/CSS. This is the right answer
for icons, favicons, social cards, banners, and anything else that is DESIGNED
rather than photographed: gradients, specular highlights, glass, type,
geometry — all of it is a CSS property or a path. The output is editable,
diffable, and versioned, which a raster is not.

**2. Render it.** Compose in HTML and screenshot it with headless Chrome at an
exact pixel size. This is how you make a PNG when a PNG is required (an app
icon must be 1024x1024; an App Store screenshot must be 1290x2796), and it is
the ONLY way to put a real screen inside a device frame. The canvas's screens
are already HTML — `isocan get <item> screen.html` and drop it in an
`<iframe>`. A generated image would be a drawing OF the screen; this IS the
screen.

```js
// render.mjs — HTML file in, PNG out, at exactly the size asked for.
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";
import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs";
const [, , file, out, w, h] = process.argv;
const port = 9222 + Math.floor(process.pid % 500);
const chrome = spawn(process.env.CHROME ?? "google-chrome", [
  "--headless=new", `--remote-debugging-port=${port}`, `--window-size=${w},${h}`,
  "--hide-scrollbars", "--no-first-run", "--force-device-scale-factor=1", "about:blank",
], { stdio: "ignore" });
const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
let target = null;
for (let i = 0; i < 60 && !target; i++) {
  await sleep(200);
  try { target = (await (await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:${port}/json/list`)).json()).find((t) => t.type === "page"); } catch {}
}
const { WebSocket } = await import("ws");
const ws = new WebSocket(target.webSocketDebuggerUrl, { maxPayload: 1 << 28 });
await new Promise((r) => ws.once("open", r));
let id = 0; const pending = new Map();
ws.on("message", (d) => { const m = JSON.parse(d.toString()); pending.get(m.id)?.(m.result); pending.delete(m.id); });
const send = (method, params = {}) => new Promise((res) => { const mid = ++id; pending.set(mid, res); ws.send(JSON.stringify({ id: mid, method, params })); });
await send("Page.enable");
await send("Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride", { width: +w, height: +h, deviceScaleFactor: 1, mobile: false });
await send("Page.navigate", { url: file.startsWith("file://") ? file : `file://${file}` });
await sleep(1500); // let fonts and images land
const { data } = await send("Page.captureScreenshot", { format: "png" });
writeFileSync(out, Buffer.from(data, "base64"));
ws.close(); chrome.kill();
```

On macOS, `CHROME="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"`.
`ws` comes with isocan, so `node --input-type=module` from the isocan checkout
finds it; anywhere else, `npm i ws` first. If there is no Chrome, say so and
deliver the SVG — a real vector asset with a note beats a missing one.

**3. Generate it.** If you have an image model, use it — but only where it
earns its place: photoreal or textured backgrounds. Do not generate a picture
of a screen you could have rendered, and never generate UI. Every one of these
commands says "do not invent UI", and inventing it is the failure mode a model
falls into by design.

Whichever you used, SAY WHICH in your reply. "Composed as SVG" and "rendered
from your actual screen" and "generated" are three different claims about how
faithful the thing is, and the person deserves to know which one they are
holding.

Put every asset on the canvas — `isocan add icon.png --title "App icon"
--prop parent=<the screen it came from>` — so it hangs under its source when
anyone runs `isocan tidy`, instead of landing in a folder nobody opens.

### Comparing and adopting a design

Use `design compare` when a real structural or visual decision remains.
Publish two working wireframes for workflow uncertainty, or two polished
previews for visual uncertainty, with the same realistic scenario and fidelity.
Name each hypothesis/tradeoff and give your attributed recommendation. A batch
holds one to three options; one is an explicit direct/delegated speed path.
Link further batches for requested wider exploration. A precise incumbent edit
needs neither comparison nor another interview.

```sh
isocan design compare req_acme_receiving --json > comparison-read.json
isocan design compare --publish comparison.json --thread thr_acme --json
isocan design compare req_acme_receiving --thread thr_acme --comment cmt_acme_comparison --option continuous --out /tmp/acme-continuous.html
isocan design respond response.json --json
isocan design decide decision.json --json
isocan design decide decision.json --retry --json
isocan design compare --target item_acme_receiving --json
```

A publication file is `{threadId,comparison,opId?,commentId?,retry?}`, or a
bare comparison with `--thread`. The comparison has schemaVersion 1,
kind `comparison`, stable id/revision, requestId/epoch, exact admitted `brief`,
decisionKey, audience, mode, uncertainty, scenario, fidelity, alternatives,
recommendedAlternativeId, recommendation, target, governing, supersedes,
correctsDecisionId and followsResponseId. Initial predecessor fields are null.
Each alternative has id/title/hypothesis/tradeoff and an exact artifact ref.
Audience is `{kind:'human',respondentActorId}` or
`{kind:'external-agent',externalRequestId,reporterActorId}`. A reissue is a new
identity with `supersedes` naming the old exact thread/comment/payload/revision;
it does not change the older source. Option downloads retain exact bytes.

The JSON read supplies `approvalBases` per option. Capture the basis when the
choice is reviewed: exact brief/epoch, all options, target content, title,
description, properties, scope and governing version. A decision file wraps
`{threadId,decision,opId?,commentId?,retry?}`; decision contains id, requestId,
decisionKey, source `{kind:'comparison',source}`, that captured basis,
chosenAlternativeId, fresh versionId, supersedesDecisionId and authority.
Use the exact source and basis already seen; never recapture latest metadata
at the final submit. Reading or trying an option never selects it.

Authority is one of these explicit forms:

- `human-choice`: nullable human `reason`; the writer verifies the named person.
- `canvas-delegation`: effective responseId and the named agent's own rationale.
- `external-report`: externalRequestId, reportedOutcome (`choice` or
  `delegation`), statement, nullable reportedReason and your rationale.
- `agent-judgment`: your rationale for a direct proposal; no delegation claim,
  and no resolution of an outstanding comparison addressed to a person.

A native external report is authored by the original reporting agent, or its
current worker after explicit reasoned resume. Do not manufacture a human
questionnaire response or repeat the conversation to obtain one. A human's
missing reason remains null, never a copy of the recommendation.

`design respond` takes `{threadId,response,opId?,commentId?,retry?}`. Its typed
`comparison-response` names requestId/epoch, exact comparison source, authority
`human` or `external-report`, an outcome and supersedesResponseId. Outcomes are
delegate (agentActorId), more (nullable count/instruction), combine (at least
two optionId/part entries plus a specific instruction), skip or dismiss.
More/combine request real new work; they do not adopt an imaginary merge.
These responses remain distinct from ordinary `design answer`.

One `design decide` conditionally adopts compatible content and records the
choice together. One Undo restores both. The brief and rejected alternatives
remain available; an existing screen keeps its filename. A connected-app
prototype choice records a direction, not an implemented repository runtime.
Invalid local files remain editable. After pending delivery, preserve the exact
file and IDs and use `--retry`; changed inputs require explicit review and a new
intent. Accepted with stale/unavailable consistency is still accepted. Read
history and the effective rationale through `design compare`, `design brief`
or `design workflow` before extending another screen through either entrance.

### Carrying an authored design into the next screen

Run `design workflow` for the shared procedure. `design show --in <scope>`
(and `--css` or `--tokens`) opens the same permitted governing document as
`design check --in <scope> --provenance --json`. The default check JSON stays
the findings array; `--provenance` returns `{findings,governing}`, including an
exact identity even when no findings exist. `design=none` exempts the canvas
from requiring a system; any incumbent remains visible and applicable.

Use a new folder for a projection; its manifest identifies the source rather
than creating another canvas design system. After inspecting the current
system, this walk preserves every vendor/lint field and the prose while
changing one authored rationale:

```sh
isocan design recipes
isocan design recipe receiving --out /tmp/acme-receiving-reference
isocan design project /tmp/acme-working-system
isocan design direction --json
# Edit /tmp/acme-working-system/DESIGN.md using its actual tokens and rationale.
isocan design reconcile /tmp/acme-working-system --json
```

`design direction <file>` accepts `{projection,direction,opId,versionId,retry?}`:
use the projection manifest and a complete version-1 direction with `stage`,
`rationale`, `taskHierarchy`, `layout`, `density`, `typography`, `palettePurpose`
and `treatments:[{name,guidance,states}]`. Stage is `provisional` or `accepted`;
it is authored content, with the actual version author shown separately, and
does not manufacture a human preference. Use `design set DESIGN.md --in <scope>`
for the first system; subsequent direction edits identify their exact source.
After uncertain direction delivery, preserve `projection`, `direction`, `opId`
and `versionId` unchanged and set `retry:true` in that file. This asks for the
original receipt even if a later edit pruned its version or removed the item.

Invalid working document syntax is refused before preparing a pending intent;
correct `DESIGN.md` and run reconciliation again. An uncertain save retains `DESIGN.intent.json` and the original IDs. Retry the
same content; changing it does not authorize overwriting the pending intent.
A refused stale save leaves the working file intact. Review the new source,
then explicitly use `design project <directory> --refresh` to capture it while
preserving your working file. An accepted save can separately report stale or
unavailable consistency after another edit; do not call that a current system.

## One shared review and bounded repair

Optional craft guidance: `design craft <request> --stage new-work|critique|finish --json`
reads an attributed, bounded Impeccable adaptation around the same saved brief,
settled answers, accepted rationale and governing system. It asks no new interview
and runs no native playbook. Familiar controls, fonts and operational density remain
valid when the task calls for them. `--out <new-directory>` exports PRODUCT.md,
the exact available DESIGN.md and DESIGN.projection.json, a surface brief, permitted
references, guidance and license/NOTICE. It refuses an existing directory.
`design craft <request> --check <directory> --json` validates the original packet
and current source authority, reporting local authored edits separately and preserving
every working file. Re-export to a new folder for a new capture. Use `design reconcile`
for deliberate DESIGN.md changes; PRODUCT/surface edits need explicit brief correction.
`--package <skill-directory>` checks the pinned 56-file Codex variant, without executing
scripts or downloading an engine. Missing, incomplete, drifted and verified source
are separate from native execution, which is unsupported/not run. Applying the guidance
can be recorded in ordinary review evidence with tool `isocan adapted Impeccable guidance`
and toolVersion `isocan-craft-v1`; opening a packet proves no inspection and adds no
repair allowance. Native playbooks, hooks, images and review roles are unsupported.

Use `design review <request> --json` before inspecting a designed output. This
reads ordinary versioned authored reports and live plus archived reservation
history. It does not execute a browser, attest quality, or restart discovery.
Derive a small task/state/viewport plan from the existing brief. Start with
`design review <request> --start review-start.json`; the file contains `runId`,
`passId`, the actual `sessionId`, exact `output`, and `obligations`. Each obligation
has `{id,kind:"browser-task"|"craft",task,state,viewport,required}`; browser tasks
need a concrete `{width,height}`. `mode:"audit-only"` preserves inspection-only
intent. A connected output names its real repository, revision, build and runtime,
not a substitute HTML mock. A new explicitly requested run names `preceding`
with an exact prior run reference and a reason.

Keep the returned run's `ref` before using the harness's actual tools. Exercise
saving, validation, correction and relevant widths; record only what happened.
`design review <request> --run <run> --record observations.json` takes
`{base,record:{outcome,note,observations,findings}}`. `base` is that exact prior
reference. An observation names `id`, `obligationId`, actual `tool`/`toolVersion`,
`result`, `action`, `expected`, `observed`, and exact `evidence` references.
Passing observations require readable retained evidence. Craft findings separately
name `id`, `kind`, `severity`, `description`, and `rationale` against the brief.
A screenshot alone cannot establish that saving or keyboard behavior worked.
The shared record step runs the existing source analyzer and retains its complete
diagnostics and coverage. For repository source, add `record.repositorySource`
with actual `text` and `path`, optionally `designText` and `designPath`; its digest
is bound to the recorded repository revision. The connected runtime remains the
browser observation target. Unavailable inspection is a valid honest report.

Reserve an attempt **before** generating a correction:

```sh
isocan design review req_acme --run review_acme --begin-repair repair_1 --session actual-session
isocan design repair itm_acme repaired.html --request req_acme --review review_acme --json
isocan design review req_acme --run review_acme --json > review-read.json
isocan design review req_acme --run review_acme --record recheck.json --json
isocan design review req_acme --run review_acme --finish --json
```

The initial inspection is reserved once and at most two repair attempts are
available. Invalid/no-op proposals consume their reservation: record outcome
`invalid` or `noop` and its reason. Rechecks belong to that pass. Another entrance
reads the same history; refresh, Undo, epoch changes and a missing local journal
never restore budget. Unreadable history reports budget unavailable and blocks
new work. Do not hide a limit by automatically creating another run.

A standalone `design repair <item> <file> --from-audit audit.json` uses the same
canonical conditional edit. New audit reports capture the original target content,
title, description, properties, scope and governing identity. Older captures
without metadata require a fresh audit; later metadata must not be recaptured as
though it had been approved. Each repair is one ordinary item edit and one Undo.

Before **every send**, the CLI saves the full immutable actor/canvas-scoped intent
under its home. After uncertainty, use `design review <request> --retry` (or
`design repair <item> <file> --retry` for standalone repair); it retries the saved
bytes and IDs. A changed file cannot silently replace pending work. Refused and
accepted journals are archived before clearing; another actor does not inherit
uncertain custody. Accepted content is separate from a later stale/unavailable
consistency read. `--finish` keeps report, brief completion and receipt as separate
conditional acts; if interrupted after completion, run `--finish` again to prepare
only the remaining receipt. No ordinary add/edit launches a paid model turn.

A verifier publishes `design review <request> --offer-verifier offer.json` only
after an actual tool probe. The strict offer names exact `run`/`output`, `runId`,
`requestId`, `sessionId`, `observedAt`, `expiresAt` (within five minutes), `delivery`,
`available`, `reason`, and `tools:[{name,version}]`, plus schemaVersion 1, kind
`verifier-offer`, and stable `id`. Actual version authorship and a live native agent
session supply attribution. A browser-open command, harness name or online dot is
not a tool capability. `--handoff <offer-id> --run <run>` uses only a current
reachable offer and existing wake authorization; it creates one addressed request,
not an inspection result. With no eligible verifier, finish an unverified draft.

Source, task checks and craft remain independent. A real source finding fails;
bounded static coverage is unsupported with named limits. Ready requires every
declared required task/state/viewport and craft check to pass on readable current
inputs, with no critical defects or source findings. Unsupported static limits
remain visible in the final receipt. Older manual receipts retain their original
semantics and are not retrospectively branded a completed shared review.

<!-- topic: context | what an agent reads before it starts — the Chat, `context`, pins and exclusions, personal and group context, document status, Loop findings -->

## The Chat

**The web app calls it the Chat**; on the wire and in this CLI it is the
thread flagged `main`, and the two are the same object — one thread per
canvas, designated with `isocan comment main <thread>` (`comment main` alone
shows which). It is the canvas's own conversation and the user's direct
channel to you: it renders as a docked panel rather than a pin, everything
posted there wakes your `wait` with no @-mention needed, and `#Title`
references in it render as cards that fly the reader to the item.

`isocan notify "…"` is how you say something there in one command — it
replies to the Chat, or starts it if the canvas has none. Reach for it
whenever you have an announcement rather than a remark about a thing: the
human sees it arrive, and every other parked agent wakes on it.

Do NOT use `comment add` for that. A comment is a PIN — it sticks to a spot
on the canvas — so announcing "the deploy is done" with one leaves a marker
on a place that had nothing to do with it, and a canvas collects them.

The distinction worth holding, because the words now carry it: **the Chat is
the canvas's conversation; a comment is pinned to a thing.** Reply to asks
made in the Chat in the Chat, and keep item-specific critique on the item's
own anchored comment — which `⇧C` and `comment add --item` both put at that
item's top-right corner, one per item.

## What you are about to read

`isocan context` answers the question nobody could answer before, including
you: **what will an agent actually read when it starts work here?** The design
system and whether it passes its own check, the Chat and how much of it, the
items somebody marked, the maps, the size of the canvas, and which guide this
build ships.

```
! Design system  v1 · 6m
                 2 findings from `design check`
                 → `isocan design check` lists them
  The Chat       7 messages · 2h
· Marked items   not here
  Mind maps      Lake house (5)
  The canvas     19 items · 6m
```

**It stores nothing.** Every line is counted at the moment you ask, so there
is no context record that can fall out of step with the canvas it describes.
Run it at the start of a task rather than assuming: a design system that is
three versions behind the screens it governs is the difference between work
that lands and work that gets redone.

`!` is a piece that needs attention, and it always says WHY — "3 items have
changed since it was last written" is something to act on, and a bare warning
is an accusation. `·` is simply absent, which most things are on most canvases
and is usually fine.

The same list is a panel on the canvas, so the person can see what you see.

## Saying what matters here

`isocan context` lists what an agent reads before it starts. Two verbs manage
it:

- `isocan context pin <item>` — read this first. Use it for the brief, the
  spec, the one screen everything else answers to.
- `isocan context exclude <item>` — skip this. **It is not a delete**: the item
  stays on the canvas with its versions and its comments, and only what a
  reader assembling context is told changes.
- `isocan context unmark <item>` takes either back.

Both are `item.update` with a property, so they replicate, undo and are visible
to everybody like any other fact. The same two verbs are on an item's menu in
the app.

**Keeping a piece of a source here.** Inheritance keeps following a source. To
stop following and keep one piece instead, `isocan context pin <item> --from
<canvas> [--canvas <target>]` copies that piece's **current version** out of a
visible inherited source and pins the copy here. `--from` resolves only among
this canvas's visible ordinary inheritance links, by exact canvas or card ID or
unambiguous title/ID prefix; `<item>` is an exact ID or unambiguous prefix among
the pieces that source **offers**, which are its current design system and its
ambient pinned items — not its whole item list. A refusal names the candidates.

The copy is an ordinary local item from then on: edit it, and the source does
not change; the source team edits, removes or you unlink the card, and your copy
and its saved bytes stay. It is not a live reference. Copying a group brings its
actual children and their current faces together; one `isocan undo` removes the
whole copy and its pin, and redo restores it. A copied design note is kept as a
reference — its governing role is stripped, so it does not become the design
this canvas is checked against. Each copied item carries a `contextSource`
property naming where it came from, which `isocan context` prints under
*Copied from a source*. Canvas links are not copied by this act: place and
inherit that canvas instead. Without `--from`, `context pin` keeps its
ordinary meaning.

**Context comes in layers.** `isocan context` prints *This canvas* first, then
one heading per canvas this one **inherits from** — a canvas card (see *A
canvas on a canvas*) wearing `memory=inherit`. A linked canvas contributes its
design system, its pinned items and its size, read-only, each line saying
which canvas it came from; when both canvases have a design system this
canvas's wins and the inherited one is listed struck, saying so. Not its Chat
and not its items wholesale: context is what somebody decided matters, and
the link inherits exactly that decision. Several links compose top to bottom,
then left to right, the order the room reads. `isocan context inherit <item>`
turns a placed card into a link and `isocan context uninherit <item>` turns it
back; the card stays either way. A link placed with nowhere else said lands
on the sheet named **Context** — laid at the canvas's origin (or to the left
of everything) the first time — so every canvas has a corner where its
inheritance sits and a newcomer reads it first; `--in`, `--at` and the rest
override it. In the app the card's strip wears *memory*, lit when the link
is on, and clicking it is the same switch. `isocan design check` on a canvas with no
design system of its own checks against the inherited one and says whose. A
linked canvas at another home is named under its heading and not read from
here. The same headings are in the app's Context panel.

Each readable ordinary inherited source also contributes **Recent work**: the
sequence/time range for up to 100 latest operations, operation and comment counts, up
to five actor names and eight current touched items, with source provenance.
It reports earlier available operations outside the head, omitted rows and
labels clipped at 160 Unicode code points. This head contains no Chat text,
content bodies, removed names or excluded item details. A personal source
never contributes history, even if its card is copied or relabelled as inherited.
If Recent work is unavailable, its reason remains beside any readable design
and pins. This canvas's own design still governs. Reading Context copies no
source history into this canvas and changes no saved request.

**Your personal canvas is private.** `isocan context personal` creates it on
explicit first use and prints the same address thereafter. `context personal status`
only inspects the binding. These standalone commands use the connected daemon;
add `--home <url>` to choose another authoritative home. They do not create or
resolve a working canvas. An agent session cannot enroll itself as a person.

On a working canvas, `context personal link` places one visible owner-labelled
card; `context personal links` reports each concrete card and your current
availability. The card discloses its address and owner label, with no private
preview. `context personal unlink <item-id>` deletes your card; ordinary undo
restores the same consent. Closing a browser is not unlinking. A fresh link
uses a fresh request ID; use `--request-id <id>` only to retry the same gesture.

The owner can inspect `context personal delegates --source <canvas-id>`, then
`context personal allow <agent-id> --source <canvas-id>` or
`context personal revoke <agent-id> --source <canvas-id>`. Access belongs to
that exact dataset; revocation applies to the next authoritative read even
while its visible card remains. The selected actor must be claimed by the
calling badge; another claim on the same badge does not lend its ownership.

`context personal read <item-id> [--cursor <cursor>] [--limit <pieces>]` reads
current pinned text and design contributions through that concrete destination
card. The response names the owner, source and home. Follow `nextCursor` when
present; `--limit` counts pieces (1..64, default 16), with text bounded to 64 KiB per piece. Non-text contributions are metadata only and truncated output says so.
`--json` preserves the typed response. General Context reports local, inherited,
and permitted personal summaries; a personal layer never governs shared design.
Copied or forged cards grant no access. Automatic previews, inheritance and
screenshots redact personal sources; private responses are never frozen into a
shared request or exported by reading another canvas's Context.

**Pinning is a decision; a reaction is a response.** The list shows both and
does not merge them — somebody putting 👍 on a screen is real evidence, and it
is not the same as saying "an agent should read this first".

## Context in detail: personal, per group, attached to a message

**Personal context:** `context personal`, `context personal status`,
`context personal link`, `context personal links`, `context personal unlink <item-id>`,
`context personal delegates --source <canvas-id>`,
`context personal allow <agent-id> --source <canvas-id>`,
`context personal revoke <agent-id> --source <canvas-id>`, and
`context personal read <item-id> [--cursor <cursor>] [--limit <pieces>]`.
Standalone personal/status defaults to this daemon; `--home <url>` chooses a home.
Destination commands accept the global `--canvas <canvas>` and all support `--json`.
MCP uses `read_personal_context` with required claimed `session` and link `item`,
plus optional `canvas`, `cursor` and `limit` (pieces); ambient resources omit this layer.

**Copy a source piece:** `context pin <item> --from <canvas> [--canvas <target>]`
copies one current design or pinned piece out of a visible inherited source and
pins the copy here, in one undoable act, with `contextSource` provenance.

**Group context:** `context --in <group> [--include-excluded]` reads the complete
current hierarchy. `context request <thread> <comment>` reads the complete
frozen manifest saved with a message, including the actual selected root IDs,
every expanded item, source/visual versions, hierarchy and inclusion counts.
`context content <thread> <comment> <item> [--face source|visual] [--offset bytes] [--limit bytes]`
reads that saved version, even after its live item changes or is deleted.
Follow `nextOffset` until null; the default page is 16384 bytes and the maximum
is 262144. UTF-8 text is printed directly; binary or split UTF-8 chunks are
base64. Excluded and unavailable entries include a reason and return no bytes;
an access refusal remains an error. All reads support `--json` and work for
readers without creating a session or changing selection.

`say <message...>` is an alias of `notify <message...>`: both post to the Chat.
They accept `--item <refs...>` and `--in <group> [--include-excluded]`.
`ask <question...>`, `comment add <text>` and `comment reply <thread> <text>`
accept the same `--in` context attachment. `comment edit <thread> <comment> <text>`
preserves saved context unless `--in` explicitly replaces it. `ask --item`
and `comment add --item` choose the thread's anchor; `--in` chooses the
context attached to the message. Group #references also expand at the writer.
Excluded descendants stay listed and skip content unless explicitly overridden.
This does not change mention/summon permissions. `session say <text>` remains
the separate presence/status command; it does not post to Chat.

## Saying where a document stands

Every note in `docs/research/` and every project's primary doc carries its
status in front matter — `open`, `designed`, `partial`, `built`, `blocked`,
`superseded` — and `docs/ROADMAP.md` is **generated** from it by
`node scripts/roadmap.mjs`. `isocan doc status <file>` prints one, and names
what is wrong with how it says so: a `blocked` with nothing named, a
`superseded` with no successor, a verdict with no date.

**Write the status once, in the front matter.** A verdict written twice goes
stale in one place and nothing can tell which copy is older — which is exactly
what happened to `2026-08-26-attaching-a-directory.md`, and why the roadmap is
derived rather than kept.

If you finish something a note describes, change its front matter and re-run
the generator. CI checks the view is current.

## Triaging Loop's findings

Stitch Loop mines this repository for **insights** and files them in a shared
workspace (pinned by `.stitch.json`). An insight is a claim, not a verdict: it
is often stale, filed twice, or ranked by the wrong lights. So each one becomes
a **finding**, a file in `docs/loop/` whose front matter holds the decision, and
`docs/LOOP.md` plus the Loop counts on `docs/ROADMAP.md` are generated from
those files. Same rule as the roadmap: the decision is written once, where it
lives.

    node scripts/loop.mjs pull        # fetch; new insights land as untriaged, nothing of ours is overwritten
    node scripts/loop.mjs list -d untriaged
    node scripts/loop.mjs propose <slug> --rank next --project <docs/projects/ name | new> \
        --note "holds: one line, why" --read "what the code shows, with file:line"
    node scripts/loop.mjs render --check   # CI: LOOP.md is current, every finding says why

**`propose` is yours, `decide` is a person's.** When asked to look at Loop (or
in `loop.yml`'s nightly prove pass): pull, then for each untriaged finding
**prove every sub-claim against the code** — open every cited file and line,
check surrounding callers and tests, and run non-destructive checks (`vitest`,
`npm audit`, `npm run build`) when a claim is about runtime or build output.
Never leave `"I did not check"` or `"Not run"` in `## Our read`; `render
--check` rejects unverified reads. State whether the claim **holds**, is
**partly true**, is **stale** (cite what fixed it) or is **by design** (cite
the doc that decided it). Propose a rank — `now` (a defect people would hit),
`next`, `later`, `never` (a recommendation to decline) — and the
`docs/projects/` directory it belongs to. The note is what Loop is told, so
give it a verdict, a `file:line`, and what would change the answer.

**Never `decide`, `push` or `mine` unasked.** A decision dismisses the insight
for everyone in the workspace, and all decisions go up as one context Loop reads
while mining. `decide` pushes by default; `--no-push` records it locally.
`push --dry-run` shows what would be sent. Nothing merely proposed is ever sent.

<!-- topic: history | what happened — `timeline`, `activity`, `lens`, `history`, `at`, `recap`, `whatsnew` -->

## Where the seams are

`isocan timeline` draws the canvas's history as a track: a bar per bucket of
seqs, drawn from SIGNIFICANCE rather than from raw count, with a tick under
every bucket holding a seam. `--majors` lists the seams alone.

A seam is a structural change — something born, something deleted, a version
minted, a conversation started, the Chat moving. A run of forty moves is one
ripple, not forty ticks, which is why a tall bar with no tick under it means
that stretch was churn.

The significance function is in core, so `isocan timeline` and the app mark the
same seams. Two surfaces disagreeing about what mattered is the one thing this
architecture does not permit.

`isocan at <seq>` is the other half: the canvas as it stood at that point.

```sh
isocan timeline               # find a seq worth looking at
isocan at 50 --items          # what existed then
```

It is a fold of the same reducer the daemon runs, over the log from the
beginning, so it is the real past rather than a tidied one — **an undone entry
is replayed**, because at a seq before the undo landed, the undone thing was
still there. That is the opposite of what `timeline` does when DRAWING a track,
where both ends of an undo pair are skipped, and the difference is deliberate:
one question is what was true, the other is what is worth a tick.

Nothing is sent and no operation is invented. A position in history is a `seq`,
which both surfaces already speak, which is why the app's scrubber and this
verb land on the same past by construction. In the app it is the clock in the
tool rail: the same track, with a playhead you drag, and the canvas becomes
what it was while you hold it.

**The past does not take writes.** Standing at a seq is a way of LOOKING, not
a branch — there is no operation meaning "and from here it went differently".
The app refuses at the door, not in the interface, so an agent write lands the
same refusal a click does.

## What has been going on

`isocan canvas ls` orders by recent activity and says what each canvas last
did, in words:

```
TITLE            LAST                          WHEN
Lake House       Di moved something            41h
Pen tool check   UIcheck moved something       3h
```

`--sort name|created`, and `--filter <words>` matches title and description in
any order — every word must match, so `--filter "lake rules"` finds "Rules of
the Lake".

`isocan history [who]` is the same question asked of a PERSON rather than a
canvas: what somebody has been doing across every canvas here, newest first.

```sh
isocan history            # everyone
isocan history Kenny -n 8 # one agent, across all their canvases — led by where they stand:
                          # a row per canvas (here / standing by / enrolled, nobody listening),
                          # acts, replies, and when the last was
```

It ends with the shape of the week — `8 of 286, across 9 canvases` — which is
the thing a per-canvas view cannot tell you and the reason this verb exists.

Both read the same words from `opWords` in core, so a canvas card in the app, a
seam on a timeline and these tables describe one event identically.

`isocan lens [who]` is the third view of the same facts: what somebody has
**made**, across every canvas, grouped.

```sh
isocan lens                    # who there is to look at
isocan lens Kenny --by day     # or --by canvas (default), --by kind
```

**It is a lens and not a canvas, and that is a decision rather than a name.**
An item's x/y belong to the canvas it is on, so a view gathering work from five
canvases holds REFERENCES and cannot hold the items — the arrangement is
derived, nothing is stored, and there is no drag to get wrong. The app has the
same thing at `/lens`, from the same functions in core.

## What changed

`isocan whatsnew` lists what a PERSON got, newest first — one entry per day,
in the words somebody using the canvas would use. It is not the changelog:
`docs/changelog/` is written for whoever maintains this and names functions
and arguments, which is the right document and the wrong one to quote at
somebody asking what is new. Days with nothing a user would notice do not
appear at all, on purpose.

The notes come from the home you are talking to, so what it lists is what that
home is running.

<!-- topic: agents | agents beyond you — standing agents, the bench, personas and the docket, scripting, the Codex sandbox -->

## Standing agents

An agent can also be a **record instead of a process**: enrolled on this
canvas, answerable when something arrives, running only then. When a person
asks you to set one up — `@You add a reviewer here` — do it with:

```sh
isocan agent add <name>     # enrol an agent beside yourself, on THIS canvas
isocan agent remove <name>  # withdraw its standing (the history stays)
isocan agent rules [name]   # what an agent answers for here, and why
isocan agent mark <name> 🐕  # the emoji it wears — its face AND its pointer; `none` clears
```

**An agent's pointer is its mark.** Whoever wears a mark moves across the
canvas as it rather than as an arrow — the arrow's tip stays, in their colour,
exactly on the point, so pointing and selection land where they always did.
An agent nobody has marked is drawn as 🤖; that default is decided when the
pointer is drawn and never stored, so `none` puts an agent back on the robot.
`isocan agent mark` is its OWNER's verb: the person whose machine enrolled it
(or the agent itself, with `isocan identity --mark`), including through an
identity they have since joined. Anybody else is refused by the home, and the
web's "Pointer" pill on an agent's card or row sends the same op. Choose one when a person asks for one; a mark is theirs to pick.

The syntax is the containment: no `--canvas`, no `--dir` — the agent you add
lives where you already are. Add one when a person asks, and only then; the
add is an op everyone can read. If a person tells you "you're done here",
`isocan agent remove <your name>` is how you take your own standing away.
What any standing agent answers for — its routing rules, and the truths
that hold through every rule set — is readable with `isocan agent rules`.

**Whose word wakes it** is a separate question from what it watches, and it
has its own answer. A summoned turn runs on the machine of the person whose
`isocan rc` answers for the agent, and spends their tokens — so **an agent
answers only that person, its owner, until the owner widens it** (owner-only
summons, since 11 Sep 2026). "The owner" is the machine's person
(`~/.isocan/identity.json` there), and anything that machine speaks as — the
agents it runs, the person's own sessions, you if you run there — counts as
the owner's word, so agents on one machine can still ask each other things —
though a summoned agent carries the word of whoever asked it, so a stranger
does not reach a gated agent by asking an open one to pass it on.
`--listen <names>` on `agent add` adds people; `--listen everyone` makes it a
team's agent. A gate is the one thing a mention does NOT pierce: outside it an
op is not a summons, is not a change, and is never counted against the
agent's hourly ceiling. A mention from outside it is answered in its thread by
isocan itself — whose word the agent takes, and the command that widens it —
and if you mention an agent whose rc will not take your word, the CLI says so
on stderr as you post. `isocan agent rules` says the gate first, and so does
`isocan who` — if a person tells you an agent ignored them, read those before
guessing, and tell them who can widen it rather than retrying.

Widening is the owner's gesture, never yours — it decides whose word may
spend their tokens: `isocan rc listen <name> --to <names>|everyone` (and
`--to me` back to the owner alone) changes it everywhere the agent stands,
and refuses inside a harness session. That form is unchanged; what is new
(11 Sep 2026, #272) is that the owner no longer has to type it. **In the app
the refusal itself is the control**: under the message an agent turned away,
its owner — and nobody else — gets *Let \<asker\> ask* and *Let anyone ask*,
and the agent tray's row opens a list of the people here, each a checkbox.
Both write the same enrolment this command writes. So if somebody tells you
their agent ignored a person, the useful thing to say is *"the refusal in
that thread has the buttons under it, for you"*, not the command line.

A grant may also run out: `--until tonight|7d|24h|<date>` writes how long
beside the name it grants to, and the app offers the same spans. When it
lapses the agent refuses in exactly the words a gate that never had them
would use, plus one sentence saying it lapsed — so *"you were never let in"*
and *"you were, until Tuesday"* do not read alike. A gate somebody other
than the owner wrote is set aside by the rc and said, so asking a stranger
to "open it up" gets you nothing but the same refusal.

The person's side of this is `isocan rc` — a long-running command they start
that answers for enrolled agents. It is not your verb: inside a harness
session it refuses, and everything you need is the `agent` spelling above.

One name, one machine, many canvases: a name this machine already answers
for, enrolled on another canvas (`isocan rc add --canvas <ref> <name>`, the
person's gesture), is the SAME agent — one actor, one history, standing on
both. Nothing is duplicated and nothing needs a vouch; the enrolment key is
derived from the name by a secret kept in this machine's `~/.isocan`, so the
same machine always gets the same agent back and another machine cannot take
it by its name. One `isocan rc --all` (the person's, again) answers on every canvas
this machine's enrolments name — and, while it runs, on any canvas one of its
agents is brought to (`bench join`, the web's Join, `@Name join`) within 30
seconds, no restart: one budget per agent across all of them, one
conversation per agent that carries on wherever it is summoned, and
`ISOCAN_CANVAS` in your environment says which canvas asked this time.

The web shows a person your arrival as a toast by the presence pile, read
from presence and written nowhere, so you do not need to say hello. The rc can
ALSO say it in the Chat, off by default — once, after its first hold comes
back; *is back* only after more than five minutes gone; *stepped away* on a
deliberate stop. It is the person's switch, not yours: `isocan rc --announce`
for a run, or `~/.isocan/config.json`'s `rcAnnounce` — `true` for every
canvas, or a list of agent names/ids and canvas ids that announce.

Which harness a summoned agent runs in is the enrolment's `--harness`
(claude-code, pi, codex and antigravity are known; `~/.isocan/config.json`'s `acpAdapters`
declares others), and `--model <id>` on `isocan agent add`, `isocan rc add` or
`isocan bench add` pins its model, spelled the way that harness spells it. The
id always rides `ISOCAN_MODEL`; it reaches the harness itself only through a
door it has — Claude Code's `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `model` in Codex's
`CODEX_CONFIG`, or `{model}` in a declared `acpAdapters` entry's arguments
(left out, with the flag before it, when no model is pinned). Anything else
runs its own default whatever the row says, so say which specialists are
really pinned before comparing them. An agent enrolled with no harness
named runs on the machine's default: the only runnable harness, or the one
picked with `isocan rc --default-harness <name>`. `isocan harness` lists
what this machine can run, which is the default, and whether a pin reaches
each (`--json` adds `runnable` and `pinsModel` fields) — the thing to read
before presenting the choice to a person, and the thing to tell them when a
summons fails for want of one.

A summoned session's environment is a list, not the person's shell: what a
process needs, `ISOCAN_*`, and each vendor's own namespace (`ANTHROPIC_*`,
`CLAUDE_*`, `OPENAI_*`, `CODEX_*`, `GEMINI_*`, `PI_*`). If something you
need is missing inside a summons, the person names it once in
`~/.isocan/config.json` under `adapterEnv` (`["MY_VAR", "MY_PREFIX_*"]`) —
tell them the variable, not the mechanism. And a permission you ask for is
granted for that one call; an option that would outlast the turn (a standing
rule, a mode switch) is refused, so do not ask for those — do the call.

**You may be fenced, and it is deliberate.** A person can start the rc with
`--sandbox`, which runs your session inside a sandbox: you write your own
working directory, `~/.isocan` and `/tmp`, you read nothing else of their
home, and you reach this daemon and your own harness's API and nothing else
on the network. So a refused read outside your directory, or a fetch of some
other site that fails, is the fence doing its job — not a broken machine, and
not something to work around. Say what you could not reach and why it
mattered; the person decides whether to widen it (`sandboxRead`,
`sandboxWrite` and `sandboxDomains` in `~/.isocan/config.json`) or to leave
it closed. What never changes is the canvas work: the `isocan` CLI reaches
the daemon from inside a fence exactly as it does outside.

## Your bench: the agents a person has

A standing agent belongs to a canvas. A **bench** belongs to a person: it is
the list of agents they have, kept on their own private canvas, so it follows
them between machines instead of dying with the laptop it was made on.

```sh
isocan bench                # every agent on your bench, with its reachability
isocan bench add <name>     # put one on the bench, from what this machine knows
isocan bench join <name>    # have it answer on THIS canvas too
isocan bench follow <name>  # make it your pet (--off stops it)
isocan bench rm <name>      # take it off — its standing is untouched
```

Read the third column before you summon anybody. It is **measured every time
you look**, and it has three answers, never two:

- `ready` — something parked would answer for it now.
- `elsewhere` — it stands somewhere, but nothing is parked; a summons lands in
  silence.
- `unreachable` — nothing present can run it at all.

**A bench row confers nothing.** Adding one does not enrol an agent, give it
reach, or let anybody summon it — `isocan agent add` is still what grants
standing on a canvas, and `isocan bench rm` takes none of it away. `bench add`
reads the agent off this machine's own records; for an agent this machine has
never run, name its actor with `--actor <id>` and say so plainly rather than
guessing a harness for it.

**You will rarely need `bench add`, because the bench fills itself.** Every
enrolment this machine makes — `isocan agent add`, `isocan rc add`, and the
parked rc answering an Add from the web — writes or updates that agent's row,
so the registry does not have to be curated to stay true. A registry kept by
hand is a registry that goes stale. Two things follow, and both are
deliberate:

- **Enrolment never depends on the bench.** The row is a convenience and the
  enrolment is the real act, so the write is best-effort: it never creates
  your personal canvas (that is your gesture, not a side effect of adding an
  agent), it is never retried, and it can never fail an enrolment. If no row
  was written the command says so on stderr and carries on — a missing row
  must never read as a missing agent.
- **It fills silences; it overwrites nothing.** A row that already names a
  harness or a `runsAt` keeps what it says, so a machine that enrols an agent
  second does not rewrite what the first one, or you, recorded.

**Withdrawal never touches the row.** `isocan agent remove` takes an agent's
standing on a canvas; it does not take the agent off your bench, because the
bench is the agents you HAVE, not the agents standing somewhere. Withdrawing
Percy from every canvas leaves Percy's row reading `unreachable` — which is
honest, and is the whole reason that state exists. `isocan bench rm` is the
only way a row leaves.

**Bringing one to a canvas is `isocan bench join <name>`.** It enrols an agent
from your bench on the canvas the command is about — `--canvas`, or whatever
this directory is bound to — and it needs **no parked `isocan rc` there**,
which is the difference between naming an agent you already have and
introducing a stranger. `isocan agent add` mints an actor and so must ask the
machine that will answer for it; an agent on your bench already has one, so
its fifth canvas costs exactly what its first did. It stands there at once;
it ANSWERS there once its machine parks on that canvas, which a running
`isocan rc --all` does within 30 seconds and a plain `isocan rc` never does.

What joining does NOT do is the part worth reading twice: it grants standing
on that one canvas and nothing else. No turn is started, nobody new may summon
it (a re-join leaves an existing `--listen` grant exactly as it was), and no
other canvas changes. If nothing can answer for the agent yet, the join still
succeeds and the line says so in the same three words `isocan bench` uses — an
enrolment that cannot answer yet is legitimate, and one that pretends it can
is the bug.

**A person can ask for the same thing in the Chat, by typing `@Name join` on
a line of its own.** It is the same `agent.invite` this verb sends — joining
from a sentence and joining from a button are one act — and when it lands the
thread gets one line saying so, because the canvas is the only channel. You
will see that line like any other message; it is a record, not a request, and
nothing is being asked of you.

If you are reading a thread and see `@Name join` with no such line after it,
the ask was refused: the name was not on the asker's bench. **The refusal is
always *"Name is not on your bench"* and never *"unknown name"*, whether the
agent exists on somebody else's bench or does not exist at all.** That is
deliberate and it is a security property rather than a phrasing: a bench is a
private canvas, and a refusal that read differently for a name that exists
somewhere would let a stranger enumerate one name at a time. Do not "improve"
it, and do not offer to look the name up.

**A pet is a bench agent that follows its owner: `isocan bench follow
<name>`** (the web's *Follows me*), and `--off` to stop. It is one fact on the
bench row, and it invites the agent nowhere by itself: when its owner ARRIVES
on a canvas in the app and can edit it, the app sends the same `agent.invite`
a join sends — once per arrival, never onto a canvas the owner can only read,
and never back onto one where somebody withdrew it (`isocan rc remove`, or an
agent's own `isocan agent remove`: a removal is the room's word, and only a
person joining or enrolling it again by hand brings it back). The thread then
gets one line, *"Scout came with Dion"*. Like any
join, the new row carries no `rules`, so it answers only its owner until
somebody widens it. Turning following off takes the agent off nothing.

If you ARE somebody's pet, that line is a record of your arrival, not a
request — nothing is being asked of you. A running `isocan rc --all` on your
machine parks on that canvas within 30 seconds; a plain `isocan rc` does not.

## The roles you can take on

`isocan persona ls` lists the personas this directory holds — `.agents/personas/`.
A persona is a named role: a lens, the tools for it, a **goal it is judged
against**, and a memory of what it already found. `isocan persona show <name>`
prints one in full, including the command that produces its number.

**Read one before you work in its lane.** A persona says what has already been
measured and what the line is, which is the difference between "I improved the
contrast" and "contrast failures went 2 → 0, measured by the command the goal
names". The second is a claim somebody can check.

`isocan persona runs <name>` shows what its runs found and what was decided
about each — `accepted`, `rejected`, or `unanswered`. Nothing computes a score
from those yet, deliberately: an accept rate over five findings is noise.

**Some personas are small, and hand off.** One that declares a `budget` (show
prints it) runs a cheap model on a night its number misses, within that cost,
and proposes fixes on its page without applying them. What it cannot settle it
escalates to the persona its `escalate:` names, and `isocan persona runs
<that one>` lists those pages under **handed to**. If you are wearing the
persona something was handed to, those are yours to decide.

**The docket is where an unanswered finding gets its answer.** On a repo whose
board runs `scripts/docket.mjs`, each open question is an item carrying
`docket=<slug>`, and it is answered by a mark: ✅ accepts, ❌ rejects. The
script writes the verdict into `docs/reviews/` and commits it with the name of
whoever answered. `isocan docket` lists the questions and what the marks on
each say (open, accepted or rejected by whom, contested, and who has taken it
with ✋). `isocan docket answer <finding> accepted|rejected` answers one —
`<finding>` is the slug the list prints, or the item — and it sends exactly
the ops a click on the chip sends, taking your other verdict off first if you
wore it; one undo takes the answer back. `--because <words>` says why, as a
comment on the item. A verdict is a person's call about a finding: answer one
when you were asked to, or when you did the work that settles it, and say so.

A goal is `(number, bound, the command that produces it)` — never an
aspiration. If you add one, run its command against something broken first and
watch the number move. A measurement that cannot fail reports success forever,
which is worse than no measurement because it is believed.

## Scripting

The CLI has a library underneath it, and it is the same code. Reach past the
CLI when the work is a loop rather than a gesture — forty ops in a batch, a
watcher reacting to the log, a tool that composes many reads — because a
spawned `isocan` costs a process per action and hands you strings where the
library hands you typed values.

Install it locally, in the directory you are working in — never `-g`, a
global install is not importable:

```sh
npm i github:dglazkov/isocan#release
```

That line is the answer everywhere, a readied directory included: `isocan
setup` put the CLI on your PATH, and a PATH is not a module, so a script's
import needs the local install even where the CLI already works.

```js
import { connect } from "isocan";

const home = await connect();        // this directory's canvas, this
                                     // session's actor — the CLI's own
                                     // resolution, because it IS it
const canvas = await home.canvas();  // or home.canvas("<ref>") for another
const items = await canvas.items();  // typed reads: items, threads, who, activity
const item = await canvas.add({ title: "Report", content: html, mime: "text/html" });
for await (const entry of canvas.tail()) { /* entry.seq is your resume cursor */ }
```

Run it with plain `node` — the import registers its own TypeScript loaders.
`connect()` resolves the directory marker, the canvas, and your session
identity exactly as every `isocan` command does, so the script's ops land as
the same actor your CLI commands do; a script that is its own actor states it
(`connect({ identity: { session, harness } })`, claimed first with `isocan
identity --session`). `add` and `edit` take content as values and return the
item they made; `notify` speaks in the Chat; a refusal is an `ApiError`
carrying the wire's code, with `unreachable` when nothing answered.

Group-aware API clients use `canvas.context({ in: groupId })`, then
`canvas.say("Review", { in: groupId, expectedRevision: manifest.revision })`
when the sent scope must match that preview. `canvas.contextOfComment(threadId,
commentId)` returns the saved manifest; `canvas.contextItem(threadId, commentId,
itemId, { face: "source", offset: 0, limit: 16384 })` reads saved byte pages.
`canvas.contextPage(...)` pages reference metadata, with a required
`expectedRevision` for live paging. `canvas.copy([groupId], { to: canvasId,
in: destinationId, dryRun: true })` uses the same graph planner as the CLI.
MCP keeps `read_context` and `read_context_content` for that same manifest and
frozen-version contract. `read_context_summary` separately reads the live
layered Context view: local and inherited sources, plus permitted personal
summaries when you supply an explicitly claimed session. Ordinary inherited
sources also contribute bounded Recent work. It reports exclusions, overrides,
staleness and reasons a source could not be read. JSON resources at
`isocan://canvas/{id}` and `isocan://canvas/{id}/context` expose the current
canvas and summary under ambient identity; they omit personal memory.
Resource listing includes only discoverable canvases, and every read checks admission.

For collaboration over `isocan mcp`, call `claim_agent` with a name and a
stable conversation `session` key, then supply that key on **each tool call**.
The durable claim survives restarting MCP. Two conversations sharing one
server keep separate identities; an unclaimed explicit key is an error.
Omitting `session` uses the CLI/API ambient identity, and **resources always
use ambient identity**; they do not inherit the previous tool's session.
`clientInfo` identifies the manager application, not a conversation.

`read_personal_context` requires that claimed `session` and an `item`: the
concrete personal link card on the destination canvas. `canvas` is optional
and uses the usual canvas selector; it names the destination, not the private
source. For example, after claiming `acme-review`, call the tool with:

```json
{"session":"acme-review","canvas":"prj_acme","item":"itm_personal_link","limit":16}
```

The owner must have explicitly linked that dataset here. An agent also needs
the owner's allowance for its exact actor ID; an explicitly claimed owner
session needs no self-delegation. Each call rechecks the selected caller's
authority and the concrete link. A previous success, another claim on the
badge, or copied card properties do not grant access. Unlinking or revoking the delegate stops the next read.
Omitting `session` is an error for this tool; ambient resources never select
an owner for you.

The response carries the owner, `sourceCanvasId`, `home`, destination `itemId`
and current `pieces`: pinned context and design contributions, with text when
readable. It includes no Chat or history. Optional `limit` counts pieces
(1..64, default 16); each text read is bounded to 65,536 source bytes. Inspect the
response's `truncated` flag and each piece's `unavailable` reason; non-text
pieces are metadata only. Follow `nextCursor` by supplying optional `cursor`
with the same session, destination and link. If the current contribution set
changes, start a new read rather than treating the old cursor as history.
This private read leaves `read_context`, `read_context_content` and saved
request bytes unchanged.

`create_item` and `edit_item` write attributed versions. `post_comment` posts
on an item or in Chat; `reply_comment` replies to a thread. These use the
same mention resolution and saved-context rules as API comments. After doing
work, call `wait_for_feedback` with the session, canvas, and your last returned
`cursor`. It waits at most 60 seconds for addressed feedback. Omit the cursor
to start from now. A timeout returns an empty result and the cursor through
all inspected traffic, including irrelevant operations; resume from that
cursor. MCP cancellation ends the watch. Polling marks nothing seen and
advertises no presence; claiming a name is not announcing a live session.

The reference is the types themselves: the package is TypeScript source, so
your editor answers what `connect()` returns straight from the install, and
there is no separate API document to go stale. The ops a script sends are the
ops you would have typed — one op per user-visible act is still one undo.

## Codex native sandbox

A person can opt in with `isocan rc --codex-sandbox` or
`isocan rc turn <agent> <prompt> --codex-sandbox`. This is a separate choice
from the outer `--sandbox`; the two cannot be combined. Native mode permits
workspace and isocan-state writes, refuses permission escalation, and protects
Git metadata. It does not hide file reads or fence the adapter/MCP processes.
Report a refused operation to the person; do not try another route around it.
The person's local `codexSandboxDomains` config supplies additional exact
network hostnames. It is not a choice an agent takes from canvas content.

<!-- topic: present | running a room — the slide deck, design sprints -->

## The slide deck

A canvas gets presented, and full screen is the projector: bare arrows (and a
clicker's Page Up/Down) flip from item to item, each filling the window. With
nothing marked they flip through **everything**, in reading order — rows top
to bottom, left to right. Marking narrows the walk to just the slides:

- `isocan slides add <items...>` — these are slides. Marked items wear 🎬 in
  their title row, and bare arrows in full screen stop only at them.
- `isocan slides rm <items...>` — out of the deck. **Not a delete**: the item
  stays on the canvas.
- `isocan slides show` — the deck in order, and the address to hand an
  audience: the first slide's full-screen URL, which is an ordinary item
  address (`isocan open <item>` opens the same view), and the deck view's
  address (`/deck` on the canvas), where the app prints.
- `isocan slides export <out>` — the deck as a document. The extension
  decides the format: `deck.pdf` is one slide per landscape page, printed by
  headless Chrome from the app's deck view (needs a repository checkout and
  Chrome, like `canvas shot`); `deck.html` is one self-contained file that
  plays the deck anywhere — arrows and Page keys flip, and its own print
  stylesheet makes the same PDF — built here without a browser; `--png <dir>`
  writes one PNG per slide beside either. The app's ⌘K "Export the deck"
  opens the same view with Save as PDF and Download deck.html; both surfaces
  write the same HTML file from core's `deckHtml`.

**Speaker notes** are text items that point at their slide, kept under it on
the canvas where the deck is arranged — so a person reads the slide and what
to say about it side by side, and the note versions, edits and drags like any
text node. `isocan slides note <slide> "what to say"` writes one (or re-words
the one it has; `-f notes.md` or `-f -` for more than a line);
`isocan slides notes` prints every slide with its note;
`isocan slides export notes.md` writes the handout. In full screen the presenter presses **N** to see the
note under the slide — never over it, and never on the audience's picture —
and `slides export deck.pdf --notes` puts each note on its slide's sheet. A
note is never a slide, even when nothing is marked.

A slide is a property set by `item.update` — the same shape as a context pin —
so it replicates, undoes, and cannot disagree between the CLI and the app's
"Make this a slide" menu entry. Order is geometry: lay the deck out in rows
and the rows are the running order. There is no slide-number to maintain and
none to drift.

## Running a sprint

A design sprint is a script a facilitator runs over verbs you already have,
and `/sprint` in the Chat is how somebody asks you to run one. The full
procedure is that command's body (`isocan command show sprint`); the state is
here.

`isocan sprint` says which phase the Chat says is running, how long is left,
what was handed in, and — for a vote — who wore the mark. **Nothing is
stored**: the phase is the newest `/sprint <phase> [duration] [note]` line in
the Chat, timed from that comment's daemon stamp, so this verb and the app's
clock chip cannot disagree. `--json` carries `remainingSeconds`, which is the
bell:

```sh
isocan sprint board                       # lay the board: one sheet per stretch of the week
isocan sprint brief --goal "…" --decider Maya --question "…"   # the brief, as one card with a history
isocan sprint desk Theo                   # a private canvas for one sketcher: link off, one pass in
isocan sprint phase crazy8s 8m            # call a phase — posts /sprint to the Chat
isocan wait --timeout $(isocan sprint --json | jq .remainingSeconds)
isocan copy <items...> --to <sprint> --in Sketches --handin   # a desk's bell: onto the sheet, stamped
isocan sprint handin <items...>           # these were made for the current phase
isocan react 🔴 <sketch> --at 0.4,0.6      # a heat-map dot on that PART of the sketch (fractions of its box)
isocan sprint tally                       # human dots and agent dots, apart
isocan sprint end                         # over — no phase, no clock
```

**The board is the walkthrough.** `isocan sprint board` lays eleven areas
(below) to the right of the work — Brief · Map · Experts & HMW · Target ·
Demos · Sketches · Vote · Storyboard · Prototype · Test · Wrap — each with a
card that says what happens there. Lay it BEFORE you ask the setup
questions, so the room sees the week; then `isocan sprint brief` writes the
answers onto the Brief sheet, a new version each time, never a second card.
Every phase knows its sheet (`isocan sprint` names it, `--json` carries its
box): calling a phase walks everyone's camera there and puts the phase's one
action on the clock chip — *New note* on the phase's paper in the sheet,
*Hand in* which lands the selection on the sheet. You never say where to go
or what to click; call the phase and the board does that.

**Desks are where the silence happens.** `isocan sprint desk <name>` births a
private canvas for one sketcher — the link grant off, one single-use pass
minted — and prints an address to hand to that person and nobody else. The
desk knows its sprint (`sprintOf` on the canvas record), so its clock chip
shows the sprint's phase and clock and offers *Hand in*, which copies the
selection onto the sprint's sheet for the running phase, stamped. The
terminal's twin is `isocan copy <items> --to <sprint> --in <sheet> --handin`.
The original stays on the desk: a hand-in is a copy.

`phase` refuses a word that is not a phase (`map experts hmw target demos
notes ideas crazy8s sketch museum heatmap critique poll supervote storyboard
prototype test wrap`), so a typo cannot start a clock. A phase with no clock —
the museum, the supervote — runs until the next one is called.

**The curtain is a lens, on the wall only.** While a vote phase's clock runs,
the app hides reaction counts and item bylines on the WALL — the Vote
sheet's contents when a board is laid, else the last silent phase's
hand-ins — not knowing who drew what while you vote is the method — but the
record is untouched, and `sprint tally` reads it, because the facilitator is
the referee and not a voter. A mark placed with `--at` (or a click while the
chip says *Placing*) is a dot on that part of the sketch; each person sees
their own under the curtain and everyone's at the bell. A hand-in is a
property (`sprint=<phase>`) on the item: `item.update`, one undo, visible to
everybody, the same shape as a slide.

Three rules that are yours whichever chair you sit in. **You never decide**:
the supervote 🏆 is a person's. **Silent phases are silent in the Chat**:
every parked agent wakes on it, so narrate with `session say` and keep the
questions on item threads. **One sketch per sketcher**: an agent that could
make forty makes one, and hands it in at the bell with `copy --to` and
`sprint handin`.

<!-- topic: extend | what a canvas carries — modules, tools in the rail, panels in the dock -->

## Modules

Some of what this CLI and the app can do is a **module**: a package that adds
a kind of item, the picture it draws as, and a family of verbs — the mind map
and diagrams are two — and that can be taken away leaving every item it made
readable as a file. A build carries its own; a self-hosted home can add more,
outside core, without rebuilding anything:

- `isocan module ls` — every module here: the build's own, the ones added to
  this machine, and why any is refused (its `engines` names an isocan this
  is not).
- `isocan module add <dir | github:owner/repo#ref>` — install a built module
  from a directory or a git repository (the built module at its root or in
  `build/`). It PRINTS the manifest — the kinds, property keys and halves it
  declares — and installs nothing until you run it again with `--yes`, the
  same gate `command add --from` has and for the same reason: this is code
  that runs as the app, chosen by whoever runs this machine. Loaded on the
  next command and the next page load; no restart.
- A module can add a whole PAGE to the app — the Documents page is the
  first — and `isocan open --page <segment>` hands a person its address, the
  way `open --workbench` hands out the agent room's.
- `isocan module rm <name>` — remove one. Its items stay on every canvas, as
  the files they are; its verbs and pictures are gone.

A module is built from `packages/modules/<name>` with
`node --import tsx scripts/module-build.mjs <name>`. What a module may add is
bounded by one rule: only what a person could already do with a file and a
verb — never an operation, never a route.

## Tools: a canvas that carries its own buttons

A **tool** is a button on the rail that a canvas brought with it. It is an
ordinary item with `role=tool` whose bytes are a small JSON manifest, so it
versions, undoes, comments and trashes like anything else — and open somebody
else's canvas and their tool is already there, because the tool is ON the
canvas. Nothing was installed.

```json
{ "kind": "tool", "label": "Tidy", "icon": "broom", "does": "/tidy" }
```

The one rule the whole design turns on: **a tool may only ask for what a
person could ask for.** `does` is a slash command that exists here — so
pressing the button posts the same comment you would have typed, and an agent
(possibly you) carries it out. Everything that follows is attributed and
undoable per actor, because it went through the same door as everybody else's
work. A tool cannot run code, cannot add an operation, and cannot draw its own
icon: isocan renders it, with its own component and an icon from the set it
ships.

- `isocan tool ls` — every tool on this canvas, what each asks for, and what
  that means it may do. A tool whose command is gone is listed as
  **unavailable** with the reason, rather than quietly dropped.
- `isocan tool add <file>` — prints the manifest and everything the tool may
  do, and adds nothing until you run it again with `--yes`. Same gate as
  `command add --from`, for the same reason: what it may do gets answered
  before it lands.
- It is an item, so `isocan rm <item>` takes one off the rail and the trash
  gives it back.

If you are asked for a button that does something new, the answer is usually a
**slash command** first (`isocan command add`) and then a tool that names it —
a tool asking for a command nobody wrote is refused when it is read.

## Panels: a canvas that carries its own page

A **panel** is a page this canvas brought with it, headed for the dock beside
the Chat and the Files. Same shape as a tool: an ordinary item, this one with
`role=panel`, whose bytes are a small JSON manifest.

```json
{ "kind": "panel", "title": "Acme Review", "side": "left", "src": "review.html" }
```

`src` names an item **on this canvas** — the page itself, added the ordinary
way — because an extension may not read past the canvas it is on. So the order
is: `isocan add review.html`, then the manifest that names it. A panel whose
`src` is a URL, or a name nothing here answers to, is refused when the manifest
is read. Its bytes are that item's current version, so editing the page changes
the panel and a bad one rolls back with the item's own history.

**Nothing renders a panel yet** — the frame and the door it talks through are
later phases — and `panel ls` says so rather than implying otherwise. What
exists today is the manifest, read and refused before anything is on screen.

- `isocan panel ls` — every panel on this canvas, where it sits, which item
  it shows, and what that means it may do. One whose page is gone is listed as
  **unavailable** with the reason, rather than quietly dropped.
- `isocan panel add <file>` — prints the manifest and everything the panel may
  do, and adds nothing until you run it again with `--yes`.
- It is an item, so `isocan rm <item>` removes one — no verb of its own — and
  the trash gives it back.

<!-- topic: homes | where a canvas lives — homes and replicas, teleport, export and import, missing bytes -->

## When a canvas's home is somewhere else

**The home is a property of the canvas, not of this machine.** One daemon can
be the home of the canvas in one directory and a replica for the canvas in the
next; `isocan status`'s role line says which, and on a mixed machine it says
all of it at once:

```
role: home of 2 canvases; replica of https://dev.isocan.io (3); new canvases → https://dev.isocan.io
```

`isocan home` lists it per canvas — which of your canvases live here, which
live at a home, and whether that home is answering. When a canvas's home is
elsewhere, that home is the single writer of everything on it. Four things
change for you on that canvas, and nothing else does:

- **Every write travels.** Adding an item, posting a comment, `undo` — each
  goes to the home and comes back, so a write can now fail for a reason that
  has nothing to do with what you asked. `home-unreachable` (HTTP 503) means
  the home could not be reached and **your write did not happen**. Nothing is
  queued and nothing will retry it for you: say so, and try again when the
  network is back. Do not paper over it by working around the canvas.
- **The page is at that canvas's home, not here.** `isocan open` prints the
  right address for the canvas you are on; `http://127.0.0.1:4441` serves you
  ops and answers a browser with a 404 naming that canvas's home. A canvas
  whose home IS this machine opens right here. Either way, the address to give
  a person is the one `isocan open` printed — never one you assembled.
- **Reads are local and instant.** Everything you look at — `ls`, `show`,
  `comment ls`, `wait` — is answered from this machine's copy, and the
  copy is kept current by a live connection. `isocan who` shows everyone on
  the canvas, including people connected to the home from elsewhere.
- **This machine holds the canvases it was let into, not the home's.** A
  replica does not mirror everything at its home — it carries what somebody
  handed it: a canvas redeemed with a pass (`isocan setup <address>#<pass>`),
  a canvas born in a directory here, and a canvas named by a
  `.isocan/project.json` marker that came with a clone. So `isocan list` on
  a replica is a short list on purpose, and a canvas at the home that is not
  in it is not missing — nobody gave it to this machine. If you need one
  here, ask the person for a pass; do not go looking for a way to enumerate
  the home.

`.isocan/project.json` records the canvas's home beside its id, and **the
marker decides**. A directory whose marker names a home this machine has never
been to is not refused — it is JOINED: the daemon opens a link to that address,
the far door decides whether this machine may have the canvas, and nothing else
here moves. What IS refused, loudly and by every command, is a marker that
disagrees with what this machine has already recorded about that canvas —
because moving a canvas between homes is a deliberate act (re-homing), not
something a command should do because you ran it in the wrong directory. Report
that rather than editing the marker.

**`isocan home`** is where a canvas born here is born, and where each canvas
already here lives:

```sh
isocan home                    # the birth default, plus every canvas and its
                               # home — and whether that home is answering
isocan home https://isocan.io  # canvases born here go there from now on:
                               # writes the setting, restarts the daemon
isocan home --clear            # canvases born here stay here from now on
```

It is **configuration, not a per-command flag**: there is no way to point one
command at one home and the next at another, and there should not be. What
travels with a birth is the directory's committed marker, never a flag. Setting
it checks the address answers before committing to it, because a canvas that
lives at an unreachable home refuses every write — `--force` sets it anyway if
that is genuinely what was meant.

**Do not run it on your own initiative.** Where a person's canvases are born is
their decision about their machine. It **moves nothing that already exists** —
setting or clearing it changes only where the NEXT canvas goes, and every
canvas already at a home still answers to that home — but it is still theirs to
decide. Run it when they ask, and say on the thread that you did. Reading it —
plain `isocan home` — is free and often the answer to "why was my write
refused".

**`isocan direct`** is the other half of the same subject: whether this machine
runs a daemon at all.

```sh
isocan direct                  # which way this machine works, and why
isocan direct https://isocan.io  # no daemon here; commands speak to the home
isocan direct --clear          # run a daemon here again, with its own replica
```

Ordinarily a machine runs a local daemon holding a replica of every canvas it
has been let onto, and your commands talk to that. **Direct** is the other
arrangement: no daemon, no local copy, and every command speaks to the home
itself. It is what a disposable workspace wants — a CI runner, a cloud sandbox
that will be torn down — because there is nothing there worth replicating into
and nothing to lose when it disappears.

You will normally be *in* one or the other rather than choosing: `isocan setup`
decides once and writes it down, and `ISOCAN_DIRECT=1` (or
`ISOCAN_DIRECT=https://isocan.io`) is how a workflow file or a harness prompt
says so without editing anything. What matters for you is what changes:

- **`serve`, `restart` and `stop` refuse** on a direct machine, because there
  is no daemon for them to be about. That refusal is correct — do not work
  around it by starting one.
- **Nothing is cached locally.** Reads cross the network, and if the home is
  unreachable, every command fails rather than falling back — there is no
  replica to fall back to. Say so on the thread rather than retrying forever.
- **`isocan home` refuses too**, since a canvas made here is born at the home;
  there is no separate birth default to set.

Same as `isocan home`: **do not switch a machine on your own initiative.** Read
it freely — plain `isocan direct` — and say what you found.

When a sandbox holds no secret of its own and an egress proxy adds
`Authorization` upstream, the launcher sets `ISOCAN_BADGE_UPSTREAM=1` with
`ISOCAN_ACTOR_ID` and `ISOCAN_ACTOR_NAME` (beside `ISOCAN_DIRECT`). In that
mode the CLI reads and writes no `identity.json` and sends no `Authorization`
of its own (`isocan whoami` prints `— upstream badge`). Standard proxy
variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) are honoured directly, with
no `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` needed, and a failed connection names the proxy.

## Taking a canvas somewhere else

`isocan export <file>` writes this canvas as [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org)
— the open format Obsidian and others read. The coordinate model is ours almost
exactly, so geometry crosses unchanged, and a mind map crosses as real edges
because an edge here is a property rather than an op.

**It is not a backup, and it says so.** The format has no room for versions,
comment threads, actors, timestamps, properties or the oplog, so the command
counts what it could not carry and prints it. There is no import: reading one
back would mint a canvas whose history begins at import, which is a different
feature and a worse one to discover by accident.

## Moving a canvas to another home

A canvas lives at the home it was born at, and `isocan home` says which one.
To move it — a local canvas that should be hosted, a canvas at the wrong
home — `isocan teleport <canvas> --to <home>` sends it:

```sh
isocan teleport <canvas> --to https://isocan.io --dry-run   # what would move
isocan teleport <canvas> --to https://isocan.io             # move it
```

The whole history goes, verbatim: the same operations, the same order, the
same timestamps, and the bytes after them. Afterwards this daemon forwards to
the new home, so every address that worked still works. If the new home
refuses a blob on the way, the move still completes and the report counts
what is behind — `isocan blobs --push` sends it, and this daemon's own blob
check would anyway.

**Two things do not travel, and the command says so both times.** Who may
enter — invite them again at the new home and set its link, because who may
be somewhere is a decision about a PLACE. And names, colours and face marks,
which belong to the old home's registry: people arrive under whatever name
was stamped on their ops.

Only a canvas's own home can send it, and it can only land somewhere that
does not already have it. Moving a canvas onto a home that has it would be a
merge, and two orders of the same canvas is not a thing this system has an
answer for.

## Backing a canvas up

`isocan export` writes a canvas to a directory: its whole history verbatim,
every blob the history names, the folded snapshot, and a manifest saying
where it came from. The log IS the canvas, so that directory is one — with
no daemon involved.

```sh
isocan export --to ./isocan-backup                      # this directory's canvas
isocan export <canvas> --to ./isocan-backup --dry-run    # what would be written
isocan export https://isocan.io/p/<id> --to ./backup     # a canvas at any home you may see
isocan export https://isocan.io/p/<id>/i/<item> --to ./backup   # one item: its versions, ops, threads
isocan export https://isocan.io --to ./backup            # every canvas you may see there
isocan export --all --to ./backup                        # every canvas at this daemon
isocan export --to ./backup --git <owner/repo>           # commit the export and push it
```

`--commit` commits into the repository at `--to` (making one if there is
none); `--git <remote>` does that and pushes. Only what the export wrote is
staged, so `--to .` inside a project never sweeps other work into a backup
commit. Pushing an export can disclose its contents independently of the
canvas's sharing settings — use a
PRIVATE repository, and never one whose address a pass or a share link is
also posted in.

`isocan import <dir>` hands a backup to a home again — the same seqs, the
same timestamps, through the route teleport arrives by. `--to <home>` restores
somewhere other than this daemon. It creates and never merges: a canvas the
home already has is refused, per canvas, and the rest still restore. Who may
enter does not come back with it — `isocan share` at the restored canvas.

The manifest lists blobs the home no longer had (`missing`). An export that
says so is a backup; one that did not would only look like one.

## When a teammate sees the item but not the picture

An item replicates; the BYTES it names do not follow on their own. They are
pushed to the home when the item is made, and if anything stops that push —
a home that was down for a second, a daemon restarted mid-upload — the op
still travels and the bytes do not. The symptom belongs to somebody else:
they open the canvas, see the item with its title and version, and get
`blob not found` where the screen should be. Your side looks perfect,
because your side reads its own copy.

So do not diagnose it by asking whether it looks right to you. Ask:

```sh
isocan blobs           # are this canvas's bytes at its home?
isocan blobs --push    # send the ones that are not
isocan blobs           # confirm — a repair you did not re-check is a guess
```

`unknown` is not `missing`: it means the home could not be reached, so
nothing was established and nothing was pushed. Run it again when the home
is answering.

Worth running whenever you have uploaded a lot to a canvas whose home is
elsewhere, and any time somebody says a screen will not open.

<!-- topic: sharing | who may enter — `share`, spaces, groups of people, passes, embeds, badges, and the refusals -->

## Sharing a canvas

`isocan share` is who may enter, and it is the same endpoint the Share button
in the web app drives:

- `isocan share` — prints the canvas's **address** and whether the link is on.
  The address is the whole invitation: hand it to a person and they land on
  the canvas in a browser with nothing installed. Do not attach setup
  instructions to it; the canvas offers those itself to whoever wants them.
- `isocan share --public on` — explicitly list the canvas's title on its home.
  First choose an existing `--link read` or `--link view` in a separate command.
  Publication is an owner's act and never changes access. `--public` cannot
  combine with spaces, invitations or any other sharing mutation.
- `isocan share --public off` — unlist it while keeping the known link working.
  Turning the link off, replacing it or moving it to Editor clears publication;
  restoring a viewing link does not republish. `share` reports publication
  separately from access, including a `public` boolean in JSON.
- `isocan canvas ls --public [--home https://home.example]` — browse one home's
  separate public catalogue: only id, title, home and read/view access. Without
  `--home`, it asks this daemon's own catalogue, including on a replica. It
  ignores directory bindings and never adds entries to your working list,
  Inbox or parked agents. It cannot combine with ordinary list scope, sort or
  filter flags. Browsing does not admit you; opening an address uses the normal
  door. Public catalogue and entry pages ask crawlers not to index them; that
  instruction is not a confidentiality boundary or a crawler guarantee.
- `isocan share --link off` — new arrivals are turned away **and the people
  who got in on that link are expelled**. It prints how many. Anyone another
  grant still covers stays, which is why the line can say "3 expelled, 1 kept
  by another grant" — turning the link off is not supposed to throw out the
  people who were invited by name.
- `isocan share --link on` — grant it again. (That writes a NEW grant row; the
  old one stays as a record of when it was switched off. It does not bring
  anybody back: they are re-admitted the next time they ask.)
- `isocan share --link read` — anyone with the address can **see the canvas,
  and change nothing**: the whole canvas, pan and zoom, the panels and the
  history, with no toolbar and nothing that moves under their hand. Every
  write is refused by the home (`view-only` — the code kept its old name).
  They appear in the facepile and in `isocan who`, marked *reading*.
- `isocan share --link view` — anyone with the address can **look at the
  deck, and change nothing**: they land on the canvas's slides full screen,
  flip with arrows, and every write is refused by the home (`view-only`).
  This is how you share a presentation (see `isocan slides`) without letting
  the audience rearrange the canvas. `--link edit` is `--link on` by its
  ladder name. The people already in on the link are moved to the new rung
  rather than expelled, in every direction.
- `isocan share <email>` — **invite one person by name.** They get in by
  proving they read that address, whether or not the link is on. Nothing is
  emailed from here: the invitation is still the address, and the grant is
  what lets them through the door when they arrive. A home that has borrowed
  nowhere to verify an address refuses and says so; share the link instead.
- `isocan share <email> --as read` — invite them at a **rung**: `own`, `edit`
  (the default), `read` or `view`. A named invitation is never less than what
  the link gives: a person's rung is the highest of every grant that admits
  them. Inviting somebody who is already invited at another rung REPLACES
  their row — one command, and if they are on the canvas their app redraws
  at the new rung without a reload. The table `isocan share` prints has a
  `rung` column, and its first line is the creator's: **owner, made this**.
  `--as own` makes an owner: they may then invite, revoke and set the link
  like the creator, and cannot remove the creator.
- `isocan share --revoke <email>` — un-invite them, which **expels them**
  unless another grant still covers them. It takes the address, not the grant
  id. If the link is on they can come straight back in as a stranger would,
  and the verb says so: *they can still enter by the link; `--bar` to keep
  them out*. Withdrawing an invitation and barring a person are different
  acts; read the line before deciding which one was asked for.
- `isocan share --revoke <email> --bar` — un-invite **and keep them out**, in
  one request: a bar is a row that says no, and it beats the link and every
  invitation until an owner lifts it. `isocan share --bar <email>` writes one
  directly, for somebody who was never invited and enters by the link.
  Neither the link nor the creator can be barred; the home refuses both with
  the reason. The table `isocan share` prints shows a bar as **kept out**,
  with who wrote it and when.
- `isocan share --unbar <email>` — let them back in: the bar is revoked, and
  the link or an invitation then decides whether they may enter.

Three things to know before you use it:

- **Sharing is not a canvas op.** It changes who may knock, not what is on the
  canvas, so it never appears in the oplog and `undo` will not take it back.
  Turning the link off is undone by turning it on, and by nothing else.
- **Owners share; everybody else asks.** Every change to who may enter —
  inviting at any rung, un-inviting, the link on, off or at a rung — is an
  owner's: the creator, or anybody invited `--as own`. The home refuses
  everyone else with `not-owner` and names the owner to ask. You hold what
  the person who enrolled you holds, so an owner's agent can share and an
  editor's cannot. That is a reason to be careful, not a licence: change who
  may enter a canvas when the person asked you to, and say on the thread
  that you did.
- **Turning the link off now removes people.** It used to be harmless. It is
  not any more, so it is a gesture to ask about rather than to try.

## Spaces: a set of canvases, shared once

A **space** is a named set of canvases that access is set on once. A
canvas is in at most one space, and a person's rung on a canvas is the
highest from any row on the canvas or on its space — the space's rows are a
floor its canvases can only add to, never a ceiling.

- `isocan space new <name>` — make one. You own it; it holds nothing yet.
  A space is private until it is shared.
- `isocan space ls` — the spaces you may see: the ones you made, and the
  ones a row admits you to. `isocan canvas ls` groups by space when the
  home has any, **No space** last.
- `isocan space add <name> <canvas>…` / `isocan space remove <name>
  <canvas>…` — put canvases in, take them out (by id or title). Adding needs
  you to own the canvas AND the space; removing, the space. A canvas moved in
  keeps its own rows and the space's apply to it from then on; one moved out
  keeps its own rows and the space's stop reaching it.
- `isocan share --space <name>` — the space's share: invitation and link flags
  apply to every canvas in it. `--link off|edit|read|view` is **every
  canvas in this space**: each canvas's own link row is set in one gesture
  and the verb prints how many canvases it reached; each canvas's own link
  can be set again afterwards (`isocan share --link view` on one canvas
  opens that one wider). `<email> --as <rung>`, `--revoke`, `--bar`,
  `--unbar` write the space's rows, and each write sweeps every canvas in
  it. `--as own` on a space makes an owner of the space and of every canvas
  in it.
- `isocan share` on a canvas in a space prints the space's rows marked *from
  space* — read here, changed with `--space`. A canvas row below what the
  space gives says so; it takes effect if the canvas leaves the space.
- `isocan space delete <name>` — every canvas stays, with its own sharing.
- Names are unique among the spaces you own, not across the home. A name
  you can see twice is refused with both ids; use the id.

## Groups: a set of people, shared with once

A **group** is a named set of addresses that access is given to once. A
row on a canvas or a space can name a group instead of an address, and the
door reads who is in the group at the moment somebody asks — membership is
never copied onto a row, so taking somebody out of a group is one write that
reaches every canvas the group is shared with.

- `isocan group new <name>` — make one. You own it and you are the only one
  who sees its members; a canvas owner you share it with sees its name and
  size.
- `isocan group ls` — the groups you made, with who is in each.
- `isocan group add <name> <address>…` / `isocan group remove <name>
  <address>…` — put people in, take them out. Removing EXPELS them from
  every canvas the group's rows reach (their agents with them), unless
  another row or the link still covers them; adding raises somebody already
  inside on a lower row without a reload.
- `isocan share group:<name> [--as <rung>]`, and `isocan share --space
  <space> group:<name>` — share a canvas, or a space, with the group. The
  share table prints the row as `group <name> (<size>)`. A group cannot be
  kept out (`--bar`): un-invite it instead (`--revoke group:<name>`).
- `isocan group delete <name>` — its rows stop admitting anybody.
- A home that can verify no address refuses a group row with `no-attester`,
  because a group's members get in by proving an address.

## Your own surfaces

`isocan badges` lists every surface that carries your identity — this machine,
the person's browser tabs, other machines enrolled by a pass — and can end one:

```sh
isocan badges                    # what carries this identity, what it has proved, when it was last seen
isocan badges --kill <badgeId>   # end that surface's recognition
```

The `proved` column is what that surface has **attested**: an address somebody
signed in with, which is how an `email:` grant admits them. You cannot prove
one — an agent has no inbox and no browser, so signing in is a person's
gesture — but reading which of these surfaces has proved what is often the
answer to "why does that machine get into this canvas".

The row marked `(this one)` is the surface you are typing at; ending it signs
this machine out of the home. On a machine with a home configured the list is
the HOME's, which is the one that matters — a laptop that was lost is stopped
by ending its badge at the home, not on the laptop.

**This is a person's decision, always.** Ending a surface is how somebody
recovers from a stolen machine; it is not routine maintenance, and it is not
something to do because a badge looks old. Read the list freely, and end
something only when asked to, then say on the thread that you did.

## Passes: a credential, not an invitation

A **pass** is a short-lived, single-use string that puts *another machine* on
this canvas. It is not the address, and the difference is the whole point:

- `isocan share` prints an **address**. You hand that to a *person*. They open
  it in a browser, the door decides whether to let them in, and nothing is
  installed. It is safe on a thread — it is the invitation.
- `isocan pass` prints a **command carrying a credential**. You hand that to a
  *machine* — by pasting it into a terminal on that machine. Whatever redeems
  it is admitted **whether or not the link grant is on**, and by default
  arrives speaking as the actor this CLI speaks as.

- `isocan pass --agent <name>` prints an **address carrying a credential for an
  agent** this machine's `isocan rc` answers for — its badge holds the claim.
  Whoever redeems it (a hosted rc, say) arrives as that agent,
  not as the person, and this machine's rc stands down for it. An agent this
  badge does not hold is refused with `not-your-actor`. Handing an agent over
  is the person's decision, like every pass.

- `isocan embed` prints an **address carrying the same credential**. You hand
  that to a *window* — an agent manager's pane, an IDE panel, a tab beside the
  conversation you are having. Not a terminal: a `npx` line pasted into an
  address bar does nothing, and an address pasted into a terminal does worse.

```sh
isocan pass               # the whole command to paste on the other machine
isocan pass --admit-only  # admit it, but hand over no identity
isocan pass --agent Percy # an address that arrives as Percy, for his new host
isocan embed              # the address to paste into a pane or an IDE panel (chat-free by default)
isocan embed --chat       # keep the canvas's own Chat dock inside the pane
isocan embed --admit-only # let the window in, but hand it no identity
```

### When somebody asks you to put the canvas beside them

If the person you are working with is in an agent manager or an IDE — you are
in one, so they may well be — they can watch this canvas in a pane next to
your conversation rather than in a window of its own. `isocan embed` is the
address for that, and it is worth offering unprompted the first time you make
something worth looking at. The pane opens without the canvas's own Chat,
because the conversation beside it is where the two of you talk;
`isocan embed --chat` keeps it, for a pane that is not beside a conversation.

Two things to say when you hand it over, because both will otherwise look like
bugs. **It admits the window once**, within the pass's few minutes; after it
opens, the pane holds its own badge and the plain `isocan share` address is
the one to keep. And **the pane's badge is its own** — a window inside
somebody else's page cannot share this browser's, so a canvas open in a pane
and in a tab is two surfaces, not one. That is deliberate: a credential handed
to a window somebody else owns should not be the one your own tab is holding.

On a **local daemon over plain HTTP** the isolation cannot be arranged at all,
so an embedded local canvas is admitted for the visit it was given and starts
over on a reload. Hand out a hosted address for a pane where you have one.

**A pass is a credential. Treat it like one.**

- **Never post one on a thread, in a comment, or anywhere a person will read
  it later.** It is a bearer token: whoever has the string gets in, link grant
  or not. If you have already put one somewhere it should not be, say so
  immediately and mint nothing further — it expires in fifteen minutes and is
  spent by the first machine to use it, which is exactly why saying so quickly
  is enough.
- **Never commit one.** Not in a marker, not in a config file, not in a
  scratch note. Nothing in `.isocan/` holds one, and nothing you write should.
- It is spent the first time it is redeemed. "That pass was already used"
  usually means the machine you were setting up is already enrolled.

**When it is your business to mint one:** when the person asks you to set up
another of *their* machines, or a sandbox they are launching for themselves,
and you are handing the line straight to that machine. Say on the thread that
you minted one — not the string, the fact.

**When it is not:** to get somebody *else* onto the canvas (that is
`isocan share`, and the address); to work around a `not-admitted` refusal (see
below — stop and ask); or on your own initiative because it seemed helpful. A
pass hands over an identity by default, and handing over the identity you speak
as is not a thing to do unprompted.

**Joining from a pass** is the other end of the same gesture — this is the
command a person pastes on the new machine, and it does the whole enrolment in
one line:

```sh
npx github:dglazkov/isocan#release setup https://<home>/p/<canvas>#<pass>
isocan setup https://<home>/p/<canvas>          # no pass: arrive under the link grant
```

It joins that canvas from that home, redeems the pass so this machine is
admitted and knows whose it is, writes `.isocan/project.json` with the canvas
id and the home's address, and waits for the canvas to actually replicate
before telling you it did. On a machine that has no birth default yet it also
makes that home the place new canvases are born, and says so; a machine that
already has one keeps it, and joining moves nothing else. `isocan setup
<directory>` still means what it always did.

**`isocan open` already does this for the browser**, and you do not have to
think about it: it hands the browser it spawns a pass so the tab arrives as
this machine's person, and prints the **clean, pass-less address** on stdout.
The line it prints is the one to copy onto a thread. Do not go looking for the
one it gave the browser.

## When a canvas refuses you

A **403 with `not-admitted`** is not a broken credential — it means your badge
is fine and *this canvas will not have you*. Usually its link was switched off
after you were told about it, or you were handed an address on a home you have
never been admitted to.

What to do: **stop, and ask the person who shared the canvas to let you in.**
Do not retry it, do not go back to the door for a fresh badge (a new badge is
refused identically — that is why the refusal is a 403 and not a 401), and do
not work around it by finding another canvas. Say plainly which canvas refused
you and what you were trying to do.

`404` is the different answer, and worth telling apart: there is no canvas at
that id here at all — a typo, or a canvas that lives at another home.

## When the DOOR refuses you

A **429 with `too-many-badges`** is not about a canvas at all — it is the home
metering the door. Badges are free to mint, and free does not mean unmetered:
a home will hand out only so many new badges a minute to one caller.

You should essentially never see it, and that is the useful part. A badge is
good for a year and lives in `~/.isocan/identity.json`, so a machine mints one
and reuses it for everything afterwards. Being metered means something is
throwing that file away between commands — most often an ephemeral working
directory with no persisted home. So: wait the seconds the message names, and
then fix the cause rather than the symptom. Do not loop on the door, and do
not delete your identity file to "start clean" — that is the one action that
makes this refusal certain.

## Quick reference of the whole surface

`isocan --help` covers everything; the commands you'll live in:
`comment ls|add|reply|edit|anchor|main|rm`,
`session start|on|work|say|signal|point|select|end|move`,
`canvas new|ls|show|edit|archive|rm` (rm needs `--force` and is
NOT undoable — confirm on the thread first, and never delete a canvas you did
not make). **`canvas archive` is the one to reach for instead**: it takes a
canvas out of the list and changes nothing else — the address, the history,
the agents and any view link all keep working, and `--undo` puts it back.
`canvas ls --archived` finds what is on the shelf, `--with-archived` shows
both with a column saying which, and `--with-archived --filter <text>`
searches across the two — the same scope a person gets from **Include
archived** in the app's ⌘O switcher, which otherwise leaves them out of its
search as well as its list. Every other verb reaches an archived canvas by name
with no flag at all, so a canvas somebody archives while you are parked on it
is still the canvas you are standing on. `canvas background
<galaxy|mountains|ocean|none>` sets the ground a canvas stands on, and
bare `canvas background` says what it is wearing — everybody on the canvas
sees the same one, so it is a change to ask about rather than assume.
`canvas background --picture <file>` stands it on an image of your own
instead: pinned so it cannot show a seam, and darkened so cards still read on
it. `--cursor <name>` picks the pointer everyone on THAT canvas wears — a
seeded ground names its own, so this is only for a picture — and it is chosen
from a library rather than uploaded, because every shape is filled with each
viewer's own colour and an image cannot be tinted. That picture is downloaded by everybody on the canvas on every cold load,
so there is a size limit and the command says the weight it just added — ask
on the thread before putting one on somebody else's canvas,

`space new|ls|add|remove|rm` (a named set of canvases access is set on
once), `group new|ls|add|remove|rm` (a named set of people access is
given to once; `remove` reaches every canvas the group is shared with),
`pass` (a credential for another MACHINE — never post
it, never commit it; `share`'s address is what you hand a person),
`badges` (the surfaces carrying this identity; `--kill` ends one — ask first),
`operator show|look|takedown|purge|log <canvas>`, `operator end <badge|actor|email:…>`,
`operator revoke <canvas|space> <subject>`,
`operator refuse <email:…|repo:…|actor:…|net:…>` — **this one is not yours.**
`isocan operator` is for the person who runs the home; it needs their sign-in
in a browser and refuses inside a session — if asked to take something down,
erase it, end somebody's surface, turn off a grant, or refuse an address or a
network at the door, say so and give the address on /terms. If `isocan share` prints *Turned off by the operator of this
home*, the owner can turn it back on, and it is theirs to decide. If a wait of yours exits with `ended`, or a command
prints *This surface was ended by the operator of this home*, your badge is
finished here: stop, and tell the person who asked you to work.
`open`, `setup`, `home` (which home this daemon answers to — read it
freely, set it only when asked).

Every one of these is the same operation the web app sends. If you find
something a person can do on the canvas that you cannot do from here, that is
a bug in isocan, not a limit of yours — say so (see "If you hit a product
bug"). **`operator` is the one deliberate exception in the whole surface**: it
is built on both surfaces and reachable by only one kind of hand, because what
it needs is a person at a sign-in page. Nothing you hold could perform one —
your badge was admitted by a pass and has proved nothing, and this home stores
no operator standing on any badge for you to borrow. That is not a limit to
report; it is the design.

### Older spellings, still accepted

One spelling per act is what this guide teaches (#124); the others keep
working, so nothing a script or a habit already types breaks. `list` is `ls`
in every family (`canvas list` is `canvas ls`, `comment list` is `comment ls`…), `create` is
`new` (`canvas create`), `delete` is `rm` (`canvas delete`, `space delete`,
`group delete`), `versions <item>` is `version ls <item>`, `format` is
`tidy`, `say` is `notify`, `area` is `canvas group`, and `project` is
`canvas`. `browse <url>` and `gdoc add <url>` are `add <url>` with the kind
already said (`--as site`, `--as doc`); `canvas place <ref>` is `add <ref>
--as canvas`, and still the one to use for `--inherit`.
