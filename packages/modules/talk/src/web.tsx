 *   pulsing button, the level bars, the last words — floats by the button
 *   and is gone when the turn is. Nothing pops up, the way the voice-agent
 *   page's chrome disappears.
 * - The ⌘K dialog is the CONFIGURATION: the key, the model, and a test
 *   listen. It only needs to open on first run.
 *
 * The module rule is honoured to the letter: the key is a string in this
 * browser's storage (per-user, per-origin — never on the canvas, never in
 * the daemon), tool calls are ordinary operations, and removing the module
 * leaves nothing that is not already a file or a comment.

 * ## Why it reads as a voice
 *
 * The bars are not a bar chart of the level. Each takes the level through an
 * arch — tall in the middle, short at the ends — and a slow per-bar wobble,
 * so a steady tone still moves and a loud one blooms from the centre. A
 * column of equal bars reads as a meter; this reads as a voice.

 * level changes many times a second and React has no business seeing it.

/**
 * **What was said, with who said it** — the conversation's own record, in the

 * them were shown, as floating fragments with no attribution, so a glance
 * could not tell your words from the reply's and anything older was gone. The
 * history was there and the UI threw it away.
 *
 * ## Why it is not posted to the Chat
 *
 * The obvious idea is to put these in the thread above — it is right there,
 * it already scrolls, it already attributes. It is wrong: the Chat is the
 * CANVAS's conversation and reaches every collaborator and every agent
 * listening. Speech is ephemeral, half of it is partial ("read", "read the",
 * "read the canvas"), and a voice session would fill everybody else's thread
 * with a monologue nobody asked to hear. What a voice turn CAUSES lands as an
 * operation; what it said stays with the session and dies with it.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * A name column and a line, oldest at the top, newest pinned at the bottom.
 * Names rather than colours because a person reading this is deciding "did it
 * hear me right", which is a question about WHOSE words those are. A run by
 * the same speaker drops the repeated name, so a back-and-forth reads as a
 * conversation rather than a form.
 *
 * System lines — the socket closing, a refusal — are neither speaker's and
 * are set apart rather than attributed to one.

/**
 * **The module's shell record: the composer's control, and the palette door.**
 *
 * There used to be a floating mic against the canvas's right edge as well,
 * and it is gone. It was the module's first door and the composer's control
 * outgrew it: the composer has the transcript, the names, the voice picker
 * and a full row for the glow to rise from, while the floating one could only
 * show two unattributed fragments over the canvas — which is what it looked
 * like, a button hanging next to the tool rail with captions colliding with
 * it.
 *
 * **The rail was the other candidate and is not available**: the rail and the
 * dock keep FIXED lists precisely so two modules cannot fight over them
 * (`ModuleOverlays`), so a mic there would be the shell's, not a module's.
 * It would also be the wrong shape — a voice bar wants horizontal room for
 * the transcript and the glow, and a rail is a narrow vertical strip.
 *
 * Nothing is unreachable with the Chat closed: ⌘K → "Configure voice" carries
 * its own test listen.
