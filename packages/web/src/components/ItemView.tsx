          Marks, the `+`, the full-screen button and the size all live on this

          counter-scaled themselves, which put two half-empty rows under every

          shown while you point at it. When both apply the size wins — if you

 * **A screen, held on the glass until the next one is ready to take its

 *
 * Reported from a presentation: flipping between slides flashed WHITE for a
 * split second, and the fonts "load lazily every time" — the slide painting
 * once in a fallback face and then re-laying-out when the real one arrived,
 * which changes the metrics and moves everything.
 *
 * Both are one cause. Every slide is its own iframe document, and pointing an
 * iframe at a new address blanks it: the element's own `background: #fff` is
 * what shows through the gap — deliberately, see `.html-view`, so somebody's
 * transparent design is not misrepresented by whatever sits behind it. Then
 * the fresh document lays out in a fallback face and reflows when the webfont
 * lands, which is `font-display: swap` doing exactly what it promises, in
 * full view of the room.
 *
 * So do not show the gap. The arriving document loads in a second frame
 * stacked behind the one already on screen, invisible, and takes its place
 * only `onLoad` — by which time the stylesheets are parsed and the layout
 * they describe has happened. The outgoing frame is never blanked because it
 * is never navigated: it is unmounted whole, once its replacement is ready.
 *
 * **Keys are what make that true.** Both frames are children of one parent
 * and keyed by `src`, so promoting the arriving one lets React reuse that DOM
 * node — the document it just loaded stays loaded. Setting `src` on a single
 * element instead would re-navigate it and put the flash straight back.
 *
 * It cannot wait for `document.fonts.ready`: these frames are sandboxed to an
 * opaque origin on purpose (the content-origin boundary above), so nothing
 * here may look inside one. `load` is the last moment this side can observe.
 *
 * **The slides either side are rendered before you ask for them.** `load`
 * fires before a webfont has been fetched and laid out, so promoting on it
 * still shows the fallback face first and reflows when the real one lands —
 * `font-display: swap`, in front of the room. Nothing on this side can wait
 * for `document.fonts.ready`, because these frames are sandboxed to an opaque
 * origin on purpose. What it CAN do is start the neighbours early: they are
 * mounted out of sight with `opacity`, never `visibility` or `display`, so
 * the browser lays them out and fetches their fonts for real. By the time the
 * arrow is pressed the document has already done its reflow, unwatched.
 *
 * **And a slide already seen is not loaded again.** Holding one spare frame
 * would still re-fetch, re-parse and re-lay-out every slide on every visit,
 * which is most of what "the fonts load lazily EVERY time" was describing —
 * somebody flicking back and forth pays the whole cost each way. So the
 * frames are a small POOL keyed by address: the last few documents stay
 * mounted and laid out, and returning to one is a class change rather than a
 * navigation. Bounded, because a hundred-slide deck left open should not hold
 * a hundred live documents; the oldest is dropped, and the one on screen
 * never is.

/**
 * **A screen, and the two decisions that get it on the glass safely.**
 *
 * Its own component rather than a branch above, because the second decision
 * is a hook: on a home whose content origin serves strangers, the frame's URL
 * carries a short-lived signature this tab has to ask the badged app origin
 * for (`contentBase.ts`, and `content-read-auth.md` for why). Local homes and
 * homes with no content origin at all take the same path and pay nothing —
 * `useContentOrigin` mints nothing where nothing is asked of it.
 *
 * The first decision is `itemFrame`: src and sandbox built as a pair by the
 * one place allowed to decide them together (content-origin plan, invariant
 * 2). With no content origin that pair is `allow-scripts` alone — an opaque
 * origin that cannot reach the daemon API, this app's DOM, or its storage.
 * The blob response additionally carries `CSP: sandbox` and nosniff.
 *
 * Null from `itemFrame` means "the ticket has not landed yet", and the honest
 * render for that beat is the empty card the frame would sit on anyway.
