# isocan

An **isomorphic canvas**: an infinite 2.5D canvas you can drive from a web app
*and* from your terminal. Both are views/controllers over the same live state —
every operation possible with a click is possible with a command, and each
surface sees the other's changes instantly.

```

```

**The isomorphism guarantee.** All mutations are `Operation` values from
`@isocan/core` — a discriminated union (`item.add`, `item.move`,
`thread.reply`, …) — sent to one endpoint and applied by one pure reducer that
the daemon runs authoritatively and the web client runs against its replica.
The CLI and the web app cannot diverge, because they speak the same vocabulary
to the same engine.

**New here?** [`docs/start.md`](docs/start.md) is two commands and nothing
else — the shortest path to a canvas with an agent on it. (No, you do not
need Claude Code; any agent that reads `.agents/skills/` works.)
[`docs/how-to.md`](docs/how-to.md) is the five-minute version of actually
using it. What follows is the developer's route into the same thing.

**Rather see it than read it?** isocan explains itself on isocan, and each of
these is open to anyone with the address (they wear an `[isocan]` prefix so
they stand out in a long list of canvases):

* [\[isocan\] Demo](https://isocan.io/p/prj_sN8FgZuimi) — the story, told on the
  canvas it is about. Read the sheets left to right, or press Enter on the
  first slide and use the arrows.
* [\[isocan\] Getting Started](https://isocan.io/p/prj_6nodKBn0oA) — five steps to a first working
  session, then the concepts underneath: daemon, directories, home, agents,
  ops. A deck, one screen each.
* [\[isocan\] System design](https://isocan.io/p/prj_6fgykNN1_m) — thirteen animated,
  drivable instruments: the 33-op waist, the isomorphism, the life of an
  operation, the door, the two ledgers, home versus replica. Every screen
  cites the files it was read from.
* [\[isocan\] History](https://isocan.io/p/prj_Gi8oGKNALt) — how it was built, day by day,
  from the first commit on 15 August 2026.
* [\[isocan\] Roadmap](https://isocan.io/p/prj_OE-AuGl119) — every research note and project by
  where it stands, the same board as [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

The list the app shows under **? → Read more** is the same one, kept in
`packages/web/src/lib/guides.ts`; a test reads this README to make sure the
two never name different canvases.

## Quick start

From any directory, one command — no npm publishing involved, the repo *is*
the package:

```sh
npx github:dglazkov/isocan#release setup
```

That installs the CLI's own skill where agents look for it
(`.agents/skills/isocan-collab`, plus the `.claude/` doorway), makes sure
`isocan` is on your PATH, starts the daemon, and opens the app. You pick your
name there and make a canvas — one click, and it is yours: setup creates no
canvas precisely so that none is stamped with whoever typed the command,
usually an agent acting for a person who hasn't said their name yet. It is
idempotent; run it again anywhere. `isocan setup --help` for the knobs
(`--no-open`, `--no-install`, `--force`).

On a machine that has never held a canvas, setup also writes **isocan.io** down
as the birth default — where the canvas you make next is born, so your laptop
and your desktop show the same one. It says so in its report, and `isocan home
--clear` is the whole of the way back: canvases made here then stay here, and
nothing already on the machine ever moves either way. A machine that already
holds canvases is left alone, and so is a git checkout of isocan itself.

Keep the `#release` on the spec. It is the branch you install from: this same
tree with the web app already built, and without the manifest keys npm's git
installer reads as "must build this first" — given any of them (`prepare`,
`build`, `workspaces`, …) npm runs a nested install that inherits your `-g`
and leaves an EMPTY directory with a dangling `isocan` on your PATH (#47).
`npm run release` publishes the branch; `scripts/release.mjs` tells the whole
story.

Starting a *new* project this way — an empty directory, a GitHub repo, a canvas
bound to it, and agents parked on that canvas waiting to be told what to build —
is walked end to end in [`docs/new-project.md`](docs/new-project.md), and runs
in one command as [`scripts/new-project.sh`](scripts/new-project.sh):

```sh
scripts/new-project.sh acme-widgets --agents claude,codex --launch
```

One word each: a **canvas** is the surface people and agents work on, and a
**project** is the directory that holds it — one canvas today, several later.

Want only the skill, for an agent that will install the rest itself?

```sh
npx skills add dglazkov/isocan
```

From a checkout:

```sh
npm install
npm run build          # build the web app once (daemon serves it)

cd packages/cli
node bin/isocan.js identity --name "You"
node bin/isocan.js canvas create "My canvas"
node bin/isocan.js add notes.md
node bin/isocan.js open          # opens the canvas in your browser
```

The CLI auto-starts the daemon. For development, `npm run dev` at the repo root
runs the daemon (`:4441`) and Vite (`:5173`, proxying `/api` + `/ws`) together;
it takes the port from any daemon already there, so you are never quietly
served by a stale one. `isocan stop` (or `isocan serve --force`) does the same
from the CLI — both ask the port who it is rather than trusting the pidfile.

## What it does

Every feature below is reachable from both surfaces. Where a person drags,
snaps, or double-clicks, an agent has a verb — `isocan align`, `isocan
distribute`, `isocan mv --by`, `isocan set --title` (which renames the file
too), `isocan add --drawing`, `isocan ls --kind`, `isocan identity --color`.
That parity is a house rule with a test behind it: see AGENTS.md.

- **Anatomy project exploration**: Blueprint puts goal, structure, data and rule
  concepts on native canvas cards, with a searchable hierarchy and resizable inspector.
  Double-click a concept or follow a connection to explore its neighborhood:
  the focused card expands, neighbors move into compact cards, and distant
  concepts become markers. This temporary view preserves saved canvas positions,
  native selection, anchored discussion and item-focused collaboration. Browser
  Back retraces exploration; the right-rail shortcut resumes it. Existing concept
  edits use `anatomy draft` and a conditional save to preserve concurrent changes.
  Broken files have item-scoped diagnostics and version recovery; healthy concepts
  stay readable. `anatomy validate` and `recover` provide the same repair path.
  Overview, Open Decisions and Coverage show the same graph through different
  lenses. Import/export Anatomy JSON, discuss concepts, attach source evidence,
  propose HTML mocks, and save or restore checkpoints. Associate a repository
  and ask an agent to analyze it through `/anatomy` in Chat. Requests record their
  target, Chat delivery, executor reports, reviewed revision and result; inspect
  them with `anatomy runs` or the workspace. Retries and cancellation preserve
  the original receipt. Attached analyses
  expose **View Anatomy** in the canvas's More menu and right rail. Open **Anatomy** from
  the command palette, or `isocan open --page anatomy`; the `isocan anatomy`
  command family provides the same reads and edits. This is a removable module
  using the proposed workspace API. [Design and phased plan](docs/projects/anatomy/phases.md).
- **Canvas**: infinite pan/zoom surface with a minimap; items are files —
  markdown, images, video, and HTML rendered live in sandboxed iframes
  (`allow-scripts` without `allow-same-origin`). "Double-click to interact"
  hangs under the item while you point at it, rather than lying across the
  bottom of the document it is describing.
- **Inherited Recent work**: Context shows recent activity beside a linked
  canvas's design and pins, with its source and covered range. CLI
  `isocan context` and MCP summaries show the same bounded reading and say
  what was omitted. Missing history leaves readable design and pins in place.
  Personal history does not enter this inherited reading.
- **Copy a piece from a source**: **Copy a piece here** on an inherited layer in
  Context lists that source's current design and pinned pieces; **Copy and pin**
  brings the chosen one's current version — a group with its contents — into
  this canvas as an ordinary editable item, pinned, with the source shown beside
  it. It is a copy, not a link: later source edits, removal or unlinking leave
  it alone, and one undo takes the whole copy and its pin back. A copied design
  note stays a reference rather than becoming the design that governs here.
  Agents use `isocan context pin <item> --from <canvas>`.
- **Personal memory**: **Your canvas** in Context creates one private canvas
  for your identity at this home. Pin a preference there, link it into a
  canvas, and explicitly allow the agents who may read it. That canvas shows
  your linked card without a source preview; Context reads the permitted pieces
  with your name beside them. Unlink stops the next read, undo restores the
  same link, and revoking an agent stops its access independently. On a phone,
  open **More → Context**. Agents use `isocan context personal` and its
  `link`, `unlink`, `allow`, `revoke` and `read` subcommands. The canvas's own
  design still governs, and exporting the canvas does not copy the private
  source's contents.
- **Markdown reading**: Read / select text mode, a heading outline, and live
  shared text selections. `isocan session select <item> --quote "words"` points
  agents to the same saved passage without changing the document. Select words
  and choose **Comment on selection** to save a discussion on that passage;
  `comment add --item <item> --quote "words" "feedback"` does the same.
  Quotes follow unambiguous matches across versions and keep their original
  wording when a passage disappears. Relative Markdown links open saved files
  on the canvas; CLI imports bundle local images while preserving the source.
- **The Pen (`P`)**: draw freehand on the canvas in your identity color — the
  same color your cursor and your face in the pile wear, so ink is signed by
  how it looks; the ink well beside the rail switches to any other color in
  the palette, and remembers. The nib follows you over items too, so you can
  circle the thing you mean. A moment after you lift the pen the ink settles
  into an ordinary item — no commit step to find; strokes drawn in one breath
  land as one drawing. **Hold `P`** when the drawing takes longer than one
  breath: while the key is down the ink never settles, so a sketch made in
  passes — draw, stop, pan across, add an arrow — is one drawing however long
  you take between strokes, and the bar under the canvas counts what is riding
  on it. Let go and all of it settles as a single SVG. (A tap of `P` latches
  the Pen as it always has; a hold borrows it and hands your tool back, the
  same shape as `Z`.) That item is an `item.add` whose blob is an SVG, so the
  CLI lists it, the blob on disk is a real `.svg`, and it selects, moves,
  resizes, deletes, undoes, and versions like anything else. It just wears no
  card: the ink IS the item — and since that makes its box invisible, pointing
  at a drawing outlines the box you would grab, and `⌥`-click steps down
  through a stack of them. **Shapes**: the row under the ink well switches
  the Pen from freehand to an arrow, rectangle, ellipse or line — drag from
  corner to corner and the shape lands as the same kind of drawing item, in
  the same ink, with the same rules: drawn over an item it annotates that
  item and the comment composer opens, so a markup is one gesture away from
  being a comment an agent can act on. The choice is remembered per browser;
  Freehand switches back. From the CLI the same thing is
  `isocan add shape.svg --drawing`.
- **Text (`T`)**: click and type words straight onto the canvas — a chromeless
  node that is a real `.md`. The bar over the words picks a size step (S/M/L/XL,
  each readable twice as far out), a face (sans, mono, serif, handwriting), a
  paper that turns it into a post-it, a **colour** and a **font**. A colour is
  a word — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, grey — whose
  shade adapts to the light ground, the dark ground and paper, so it reads for
  whoever is looking in either theme; Auto is the theme's own ink. A font is
  one of ten families (Inter, IBM Plex Sans/Serif/Mono, DM Sans, Manrope,
  Space Grotesk, Fraunces, Lora, JetBrains Mono), fetched only when a node on
  screen names one, falling back to its face offline, and sized for its real
  width so nothing clips. Right-click the T to set what the next node opens
  with; the last choice is remembered. Agents use `isocan text --style
  --face --paper --color --font`, and `isocan set --prop textColor=…
  textFont=…` restyles and refits an existing node.
- **What it answers to (`?`)**: every key the canvas takes, in one panel —
  opened with `?`, or the `?` in the top bar, or by typing `/help`. The list
  lives in `@isocan/core` and a test checks the letter keys against the code
  that would have to answer them, because a help panel describing a different
  app than the one it is in is worse than no help panel. The same panel lists
  the slash commands available here, including any this home added.
- **Tools a canvas carries (`role=tool`)**: a button on the rail that came
  with the canvas rather than with the app. It is an ordinary item holding a
  small JSON manifest, so it versions, undoes and travels — open somebody's
  canvas and their tool is already on the rail, with nothing installed. What
  it can do is bounded by one sentence: *an extension may only ask for what a
  person could ask for*, so pressing it posts the slash command you would have
  typed, and everything that follows is attributed and undoable like any other
  work. isocan draws the button, from an icon set it ships; a tool runs no code
  and cannot add an operation.
- **Design questions with durable answers**: the dock and `design ask`,
  `design answer` and `design questions` share validated question and response
  records. A named person's choice, text, skip, dismissal or delegation resolves
  a question; another agent's progress update does not. Attachments retain their
  exact uploaded versions, and `design reference` opens those bytes after later
  edits. The dock keeps drafts and retry identities across refresh. Legacy
  questionnaires remain readable and need explicit adoption before typed
  answers can resolve them.
- **A shared design task**: start from a chat message or `design start`, correct
  the compact brief and continue through either entrance without repeating
  settled questions. The shared procedure asks only about missing consequential
  facts, with zero to three initial canvas questions. Saved outputs carry separate
  receipts naming what was checked; missing browser inspection stays an unverified
  draft, and changed inputs make affected evidence stale. Automatic enrollment
  is opt-in through the canvas's `design.workflow=adaptive-v1` property. Turning
  it off preserves existing briefs, answers and receipts; manual starts and
  continuation remain available. Independent design-quality improvements still
  require controlled evaluation.
- **Design systems that carry forward**: inspect the actual scoped source,
  record a provisional direction or reusable treatments, and carry those choices
  into later screens through the browser or CLI. Working-file projections keep
  their original version and preserve edits when the source changes. Inspect
  three runnable receiving, editorial and campaign references with their design
  rationale. Library creation uses groups for explicit scope; legacy canvases
  retain previews, downloads and source editing until migrated. Right-click a
  DESIGN.md for **Use as design system** — the canvas's, or **this group's**
  inside a group — and **Stop using** on one that governs — the op `isocan design use`
  sends; `design set`, `import` and `use` say what the system now governs.
- **Useful alternatives and durable choices**: agents publish exact working
  wireframes or visual directions with a recommendation and tradeoffs. Try each,
  choose, delegate or ask for more or a specific combination. Adopting a choice
  keeps the brief and rejected options, with one Undo for the target and decision.
  Corrections preserve history, and later agents can read the accepted rationale.
  Drafts keep the version you reviewed; pending choices remain recoverable after
  refresh or source removal. The CLI uses the same compare/respond/decide acts.
- **Review that tries the task**: a shared review keeps source findings, actual
  task checks and craft observations separate. Agents can inspect, reserve up to
  two repairs, recheck the changed output and finish through `design review`.
  Each repair preserves the reviewed context and has one conditional Undo;
  concurrent edits are refused with the draft intact. The canvas shows exact
  evidence, remaining limits and an available verifier. Requesting a verifier
  does not claim inspection; missing checks stay an unverified draft. Repair
  history and its budget survive refresh, entrance switches and Undo.
- **Optional craft guidance with the same brief**: open stage-specific guidance
  adapted from Impeccable while keeping your answers, incumbent system and
  chosen direction. Agents can export the same exact context into a new working
  folder and check it later without replacing authored edits. Human choices stay
  distinct from recommendations. Applying guidance uses the existing review and
  repair allowance; opening it does not claim a review or native skill execution.
- **Switching canvases (`⌘O`)**: the launcher's second face — a list of the
  canvases you were on lately, most recent first, then the rest by activity,
  with a field that finds one from a few letters (`lkh` reaches "Lake House";
  the matched letters light up). Three doors, one window: `⌘O`, `⌘K` → "Switch
  canvas…", or the `⌄` beside the canvas's name in the bar. Typing a title
  into `⌘K` itself also lists the matches under the actions, so the common
  trip is three letters and Enter with no mode to know about. The canvas you
  leave recedes and the one you chose comes forward in its place; the bar and
  the rail stay put, because they are the same chrome. "Lately" is the
  **seen-marks the home keeps** (#134, #147) — one row per person per canvas,
  written when you open one — so the same canvases lead the list on your
  laptop and your desktop. Underneath it, and instead of it when the daemon
  cannot answer, is this browser's own memory of the canvases it was on, so
  the list paints before the canvas list arrives and still works offline,
  where it is exactly the canvases the replica can open. Archived canvases are out of it unless
  you tick **Include archived** under the field (or press `⌥A`), which is the
  same scope as `canvas list --with-archived` and resets every time the window
  opens; a line under the results says when the shelf holds matches you are
  not seeing. An agent switches canvases by naming one — every verb takes
  `--canvas` — so there is no CLI verb for a viewport gesture.
- **Names**: an item's name sits above it rather than inside a chrome bar —
  the item is the content — and stays hidden until you point at the item or
  select it, so a canvas of sketches reads as the sketches rather than as a
  column of the word "Sketch". Double-click the label (or `F2` on the selection) to
  rename in place — the label itself becomes the field, same type and same
  spot — and the file underneath follows: "Bass tab v2" makes
  `bass-tab-v2.png`, keeping the extension, so what you call a thing on the
  canvas is the name the blob wears on disk. A name already spoken for on the
  canvas steps aside to `-2`. One op, so name and file undo together.
- **Annotation**: ink drawn over an item becomes a mark *about* it, not a
  drawing that happens to sit on top — it carries the item it annotates and the
  region it covers (in fractions, so it survives a resize), paints above its
  target, and travels with it when the target moves, from either surface. A
  composer opens on the spot for what should happen there; posting anchors the
  thread to the target, so an agent parked on that item wakes, reads the region
  without parsing a single stroke, rebuilds, and clears the mark. Ink on bare
  canvas stays a drawing: nobody asked for anything, so there is nothing to
  clear.
- **Versions (the 0.5D)**: editing an item stacks a new version on top —
  subtle elevation plies hint at the stack; fan it out (`F`, or the count badge)
  to preview and promote any version. The count badge is chrome, not content: it holds its size as you
  zoom, sits at the bottom-right of every item — where the plies are already
  cascading, and the same place every time — and gets out of the way entirely
  once an item is too small to wear a label. It steps up to the top edge only
  when a comment pin is literally on it, because a pin marks a place a person
  chose and the badge is ours to move.
- **Choosing a variation**: right-click a variation (anything `/variation`
  made from a screen) → **Choose this variation**, or `isocan choose <item>`:
  its content becomes the next version of the screen it came from and the
  whole exploration goes to the trash — the same ops from either surface, and
  one ⌘Z takes the decision back. `isocan prefer <winner> --over <other>` is
  the lighter half, a recorded preference that moves nothing.
- **Seeing what changed**: right-click → **Compare versions**, or **Compare**
  on any card of the fanned-out stack, opens before and after side by side at
  one scale, with the changes marked inside both renders and a numbered list
  to step through (← →). It reads what each kind means: an HTML screen by its
  DOM (elements, text, classes, styles, stylesheet rules), a wireframe by its
  spec ("stacked list → data table", a link's intent), text by line and word.
  Images are compared by metadata only. A variation can be compared with its
  source and chosen from there. `isocan diff <item> [from] [to]` prints the
  same summary (`--source` for a variation, `--json` for the structure).
  Comparing never writes anything.
- **Your color**: the color you wear — cursor, face in the pile, comment pins,
  the outline on an item you are holding, and your Pen's default ink. It is
  derived from your actor id so a new actor has one immediately, and picking
  another (identity menu, or `isocan identity --color teal`) is
  `actor.setColor`: it lands in the daemon's actor registry beside your name,
  so everyone on every canvas sees you change, live, without a reload.
- **Your mark, and your pointer**: an emoji you wear instead of your initial
  (identity menu, or `isocan identity --mark 🦊`) — and everyone else sees
  your pointer wear it instead of the arrow, with the arrow's tip kept in your
  colour on the exact point. An agent nobody has marked moves as 🤖 (drawn,
  never stored); a person with no mark keeps the arrow. An agent's owner
  chooses its mark with the "🤖 Pointer" pill — which shows the current one —
  on the agent's card in the pile or its row in the tray, or
  `isocan agent mark <name> 🐕`. Both are `actor.setMark`; the home lets you
  mark an agent only when one of your own surfaces holds it, read through
  joined identities. Anybody else's click is told whose choice it is.
- **Snapping**: dragging an item shows alignment guides — a line for every
  edge or center it has settled onto — and the item lands exactly on them. The
  pull is measured in screen pixels, so it feels the same at any zoom, and
  holding `⇧` mid-drag makes it markedly more magnetic for when you are aiming
  at a line rather than a place. A multi-item drag snaps as one shape. Where an
  axis has no line to claim it, equal spacing does: dropped between two
  neighbours, the item centers itself and purple measure bars — a rule with end
  caps across each gap — say the two distances match.
- **Seeing somebody else's drag**: while another person drags, everyone else
  on the canvas sees the cards move under their cursor — lifted, edged in
  their colour, and the group they are dropping into outlined — rather than a
  jump when they let go. It travels on presence beside the cursor, never as
  ops: nothing is logged or undoable, a late arrival sees where the drag is
  now rather than a replay, and a drag that never lands (Esc, a closed tab)
  glides home. A selection of more than fifty moves as one outline. Agents
  move by op, so their moves arrive as they always have.
- **The edge radar**: items that pan out of sight leave a bar lying flush along
  the rim — tucked under the top bar, against the window elsewhere, and against
  the docked panel when one is open — where a ray from the middle of the screen
  leaves the window and as long as the thing out there would be — the edge becomes a shadow of what is
  off screen, and nothing juts into the canvas. Bars on the same wall that
  overlap merge into one; hovering lists everything that bar speaks for —
  thumbnail, title, and its own distance, nearest first — and any row takes you
  to that item, while the bar itself fits the whole group. Only items entirely
  out of sight get one: something with a corner still showing is already
  telling you where it is.
- **The minimap folds away**: hover it for the fold control and it slides into
  its corner, leaving a handle that slides it back. Remembered per browser, and
  instant for anyone who has asked for less motion. Below 460px wide it starts
  folded — the width folds it without touching what you chose, so a phone
  never changes what your desktop shows — and a tap on the handle there opens
  it for the visit.
- **Walking the canvas**: `⌘`/`Ctrl` + an arrow moves the SELECTION to the next
  item that way — edge distance with a heavy penalty on sideways drift, so a
  walk stays in its row instead of wandering to whatever is nearest in a
  straight line. With nothing selected it starts from the item nearest the
  middle of the screen; the camera pans only as far as it must, so an item
  already on screen never moves the world.
- **On a phone**: a canvas opens in Chat, with Canvas and Agents one tab away.
  The Canvas tab walks spatial neighbors, opens their conversations, and
  pinches out to a plan with the current node marked. A while-away digest
  uses the previous visit mark. Message references and saved request roots
  open labelled current previews while the disclosure keeps the saved versions.
  Drafts survive tab changes, and widening the window restores the desktop's
  saved panels. Touch menus use a stationary
  long press; movement or a second finger cancels it. The narrow rail folds
  to Hand, Comment and More with larger primary targets.
- **Nudging**: arrow keys move the selection a world unit at a time, `⇧` ten.
- **The slide deck** (#87): full screen (`Enter`) is the projector — bare
  arrows and a clicker's Page Up/Down flip from item to item, each filling
  the window, the chrome resting while you present. Mark items as slides
  (right-click → *Make this a slide*, or `isocan slides add`) and the flip
  stops only at those, in reading order — rows top to bottom, left to right;
  with none marked, everything is a slide. Marked items wear 🎬, and `isocan
  slides show` prints the running order plus the address to hand an audience:
  the first slide's full-screen URL. On a phone, tap the outer thirds or
  swipe horizontally to step through the deck in the viewer or fullscreen.
  Vertical scrolling and interactive content keep their own input; a pill
  under the slide says where you are ("2 / 12"); Notes (or N) open as a
  sheet; where the browser allows it (Android Chrome, not iPhone Safari) one
  button hands the slide the whole screen; and Back leaves the presentation.
- **The design sprint**: type `/sprint` in the Chat and an agent facilitates a
  Knapp-style sprint — people and agents sketch as peers, one person decides.
  The facilitator calls phases (`/sprint crazy8s 8m`), and a clock chip shows
  the phase, the time left and how many sketches are in; `isocan sprint` prints
  the same line, derived from the Chat rather than stored anywhere. Hand in
  with right-click → *Hand in* or `isocan sprint handin`; vote with reactions
  (🔴 heat map, ⭐ straw poll, 🏆 the Decider's supervote), which the app hides
  until the bell and never hides from the record. `isocan sprint tally` shows
  human dots and agent dots apart. The sprint is a **board**: the facilitator
  lays one sheet per stretch of the week (`isocan sprint board`), each saying
  what happens there; calling a phase walks everyone to its sheet and the clock
  chip offers the phase's one action — *New note* in the sheet, *Hand in* onto
  it. Sketchers get desks (`isocan sprint desk Theo`): private canvases that
  show the sprint's clock and hand in across canvases. A vote is a picture:
  *Place a 🔴* and click the part of a sketch you like; dots hide on the Vote
  sheet until the bell. Grids draw the storyboard and the test wall
  (`isocan area grid Test 5x15`). See
  [the research](docs/research/2026-09-01-design-sprint.md) and
  [the journey](docs/projects/sprint/journey.md).
- **Wireframes**: `isocan wire "<request>"` draws a flow of screens from a
  typed catalog — blue blueprint first, grey wireframe as Jev (or the stub, or
  an agent) answers — with variations under each. Pick the screens the
  prototype plays (📐 *Use in prototype*, ⇧K, `wire use`) and `wire
  prototype` adds them as one clickable HTML item: links are inferred from
  intents, archetypes and reading order, never stored; a hotspot whose
  target is not in the prototype is drawn dashed and says which screen it
  needs; rebuilt, the prototype gains a version. `wire links` prints the
  flow, `wire link` overrides one hotspot. A composed flow ends with its
  prototype already built: Jev's first choice for every row it was
  confident of goes in (never a *maybe*, never a variation), signed as
  Jev's so a person's swap reads apart, and one undo takes it all back;
  using a screen in the prototype or removing one re-versions it at once.
  On the canvas the screens in the prototype are joined by orthogonal arrows, one per hotspot, leaving from the button
  they belong to; click an arrow to play the prototype from there, go to its
  target, or change where it goes (drag its head onto another screen) —
  `/wire links` is the same as a table, `wire play` the same from a
  terminal. Wires draw in the default grey
  look, or in the canvas's design system: `wire style` has Jev map the
  governing `DESIGN.md`'s own tokens onto the wire's roles and restyles every
  wire as one undo (`--default` goes back; blueprints stay blue). When the
  DESIGN.md changes something a wire draws from, the wire shows a quiet
  *behind* tag (and the DESIGN.md says how many): click it, or *Restyle to
  <system>* in its menu, to bring that flow forward — `wire style --check`
  lists the same wires. Nothing restyles by itself. Or pick a
  named look: `wire style --preset material` (also `shadcn`, `glass`, `ios`,
  `fluent`, `carbon`, `brutalist`, or a design-competition pack; `house` is
  the greys), `/wire style <name>`, or right-click a wire → *Style ▸* — the
  style's DESIGN.md lands beside the flow as its group's design system and
  the flow restyles, one undo; a DESIGN.md's `surface:` draws raised
  shadows, frosted glass or bold borders. `wire
  flesh` (or `/wire flesh`) swaps the grey bars for sample content, and a
  composed flow arrives that way unless asked `--basic` — Jev picks one of 24 synthetic content packs for
  the request, and every list, table, stat, card and image slot fills with
  its nouns, numbers, first names and greyscale pictograms, seeded so a
  restyle, a variation or the prototype shows the same words; `wire copy`
  lets an agent write the exact ones. A wire is the screen alone — the item's
  title names it and its frame is the device — and `wire render --all` (or
  `/wire rerender`) redraws every wire from its spec when the renderer
  changes, as one undo. `/wire` acts leave a record of what they made in the
  Chat, and ⌘K *Find prototypes* (or the lit minimap) finds the playable
  ones on a busy canvas. See
  [the journey](docs/projects/wireframes/journey.md).
- **The judge's corpus**: `isocan judge corpus` reads what wireframe flows
  already recorded — each row's round-1 P(yes) — against what you then did
  with it (kept, taken out, or never touched), so the judge can be
  calibrated before anything acts on it. It writes to no canvas; `--out`
  puts the pairs on this machine, outside any repository. See
  [the design](docs/projects/judge/design.md).
- **Design competitions**: `/design-competition` or ⌘K opens a lazy picker
  with nine designer-inspired packs. Choose fighters and a brief to create
  explicit lanes in one undoable act. `isocan competition` casts them through
  your local rc, scopes their design systems, runs exhibition ballots, and
  takes a winner as a new version. People and fighter votes stay separate.
  Bring-your-own packs, remix, rematch and standings are available; blind
  bouts remain deferred. [The phase record](docs/projects/design-competition/phases.md)
  names the real-fighter, human and hosted walks still owed.
- **MCP collaboration**: `isocan mcp` exposes sixteen tools plus current canvas
  and layered Context resources. Read items, frozen request bytes and context;
  claim an explicit durable agent session, create or edit items, post or reply
  to comments, and wait for addressed feedback. Concurrent calls keep their
  chosen identities; without a session the machine's ambient identity applies.
  Ambient calls and resources exclude personal sources. With an explicit
  claimed session, owners and permitted delegates use `read_personal_context`
  on a linked card to read its current contributed text with provenance.
  Reads and waits do not mark work seen or invent presence.
- **Canvas groups**: wrap selected items with
  **Group selection** (⌘/Ctrl+G), enter the group to work on direct children,
  add or remove members, and ungroup while preserving their positions.
  Membership is explicit: overlapping cards stay independent, nested groups
  keep their identity, and each structural act is one undo. The matching CLI
  family is `isocan canvas group new|wrap|ls|show|add|remove|ungroup|resize|frame|layout|grid|stack|migrate`; mutations
  support an actual `--dry-run`, all commands support `--json`, and
  `mv <item> --in <group>` transfers membership and places the item atomically.
  The outline under the pointer is what a press would take — the group at the
  canvas level, including the space between its members. Hold ⌘ (Ctrl off a
  Mac) to reach one item at any depth: ⌘-click selects just it, and ⌘-drag
  carries it into another group or out onto the canvas, labelled *Add to …* /
  *Out of …* before you let go, as one undo. A plain drag never detaches; the
  frame grows instead. ⌘⇧G on a member, *Move to canvas*, and
  `mv <item> --out [--to-root]` take an item out from the keyboard, menu and CLI.
  Resize scales native frames and attached ink with a fixed anchor; Fit frame
  keeps the arrangement and adjusts its border. The group's layout form sets
  or clears its named grid; lowering a count drops the labels past it in the
  same undoable save, exactly as `canvas group grid` does. *Stack* on the title
  band (or `canvas group stack <group> [--spread]`) shows a group as a pile of
  cards — the top one upright, the rest turned behind it by a hash of their
  ids — for everyone, until *Spread*; members keep their positions throughout.
  Pointing fans the pile into a hand, a click opens it into a grid (Esc
  closes), and ⌘-dragging a card out of the grid takes it out. CLI `mv`, `set --size`, `fit`,
  `align`, `distribute` and `tidy` share these semantics. Text, files, sites,
  Google Docs and modules insert with explicit `--in` membership; `--cell r,c`
  honors protected label gutters. New sandbox transcripts inherit their
  program's group. `ls --in` lists direct members and `--recursive` includes
  descendants. Group context includes the brief, complete hierarchy and attached
  ink. `context --in <group>` previews it; `say`, `notify`, `ask` and comment
  commands accept `--in` and save exact source/visual versions with the message.
  `context request` reads that complete saved manifest; `context content` and
  read-only MCP tools page its original bytes with explicit exclusions and
  availability. Copying a group preserves its internal arrangement and remaps
  membership, annotations and module references in one undoable act. Full native
  export/import retains saved context; `export --item <group>` backs up its
  subtree as item records (use the full canvas export for restoration).
  New canvases use groups by default. Existing legacy canvases offer an
  authoritative `canvas group migrate --dry-run` preview: ownership choices,
  label repairs, legacy trash and the undo boundary. Apply at the preview
  revision; stale plans refuse atomically. Native backup preserves mode and
  history. Top-level `isocan group` continues to manage people and sharing.
- **Area compatibility**: `area new`, `area ls` and `area grid` are aliases
  for canvas groups, including `--dry-run`, `--json` and grid `--clear`.
  `area ls` labels legacy geometric reads; legacy creation/grid edits offer
  migration first. Converted queued writes are explicitly refused when their
  originating mode no longer matches. Older timeline replay remains intact;
  migration undo refuses if later group-dependent live, trash or redo state
  would be stranded.
- **The workbench (`W`)**: the same canvas flipped to the agent room — every
  agent with a live session in one roster (its status in its own words,
  expandable to what it is answering and what it last made), the main thread
  beside them, and one item on a stage. It is a route (`/w`, `/w/<item>`), so
  `isocan open --workbench [item]` hands somebody the exact view; Esc steps
  back out one level at a time, onto the canvas exactly where you left it.
  A held key is one gesture — the items track the key, and one `items.move` is
  written when you stop, so it is one line in the log and one undo.
- **Comments**: threads pinned to the canvas or anchored to items (pins follow
  drags); create, reply, delete from either surface. `⌘⏎` sends, in every
  composer — a box that takes more than one line has to keep `⏎` for newlines,
  which otherwise leaves the mouse as the only way to post. Bodies render as
  markdown; `@Name` addresses a collaborator (mentions are resolved when
  posted and drive the CLI's `wait` filter) — typing `@` in the web composer
  opens a picker of everyone on the canvas, live sessions first, and resolved
  mentions read as chips in the composer and in the posted comment;
  `#Title` links an item the same way (`#` opens an item picker, recently
  touched first) and clicking the chip flies the reader to the item;
  `comment anchor` re-pins a thread after the fact — e.g. onto the item it
  asked for.
- **Reactions**: select an item and a row of marks appears beneath it —
  click one to add yours, click it again to take it back, and the smiley
  button opens a picker (recents, groups, and a search) for everything else. A mark carries WHO left it, so a chip reads "3" and knows which
  three; yours is outlined, so agreeing with somebody is one click and never a
  guess about whether you already did.

  The right-hand dock is the canvas grouped by those marks: a section per
  emoji, ordered by how many items wear it, each entry previewing the item
  itself rather than reducing it to a first letter. It replaced a favourites
  star, and the reason is that a star is one shared bit with nobody's name on
  it — a team that wants "needs review" and "shipped" and "blocked" had one
  flag and an argument. Nothing here defines what 👀 means; the team does, by
  using it, and the dock shows whatever system they invented without our
  having built it. Marks are properties on the item, so they survive a reload,
  reach the other machine, and answer an agent asking what is in play
  (`isocan react 👀 <item>`, `isocan ls --reaction 👀`).
- **The docket**: a persona finding that wants a person is asked on the repo's
  board as a card, and answered with a mark — ✅ accepts, ❌ rejects — which the
  docket script writes into `docs/reviews/` and commits with the answerer's
  name. An agent answers from a terminal with the same ops the chip sends:
  `isocan docket` lists the questions, `isocan docket answer <finding>
  accepted|rejected [--because …]` answers one.
- **The files panel**: the same dock, showing the canvas as what it is — a
  directory of files. Grouped by kind (drawings, images, documents, sites),
  filterable by name, each row carrying the filename, size, and version count.
  Pointing at a row outlines that item on the canvas and opens a peek beside the
  panel — thumbnail, name, file, size, who touched it last — the same card the
  edge radar opens off a beacon, because it answers the same question: what is
  this, before I go to it. Clicking flies to it and
  fits it in the space the panel leaves, so the thing you asked for never lands
  underneath the list you asked from. The dock holds one panel at a time.
- **Working notes**: a comment can be rewritten by its author (`comment edit`,
  and only ever your own — the daemon refuses the rest), so an agent that will
  be a while posts one note and keeps it current instead of narrating into the
  thread four times. The canvas then says how long that took — "edited · 4m",
  measured from the comment's own timestamps rather than claimed by whoever
  wrote it.
- **Selection travels with the message**: what you have selected shows as chips
  over the composer (in the docked panel and behind `⌘K`), and posts as item
  ids on the comment — so "make these two match" tells an agent which two,
  exactly, instead of leaving it to read your mind or your words. The chips ARE
  the selection: removing one deselects it, so there is one answer to "what am
  I pointing at". On the way back, a message with items renders them as cards
  that fly you there.
- **The main thread**: one thread per canvas can be designated "main"
  (`comment main <thread>`, or "Make main" on a pin's popover; the panel also
  births one from its first message). It docks as a chat panel on the left
  instead of a pin — messages hug the composer, `#Title` references render as
  artifact-style cards that fly you to the item, and agents' `wait` always
  wakes on comments landing there, no @-mention needed. Its toggle (wearing
  the unread count) lives on the Shelf; demote with "detach" (or
  `comment main --clear`) and the pin returns to where the thread was born.
- **The Shelf**: every verb in one dock at bottom center, in grouped
  segments — create (`＋ File`) · converse (comment mode, main thread) ·
  history (undo/redo) · navigate (zoom, `⌖ Fit`). The top bar holds identity
  only: canvas, connection, trash, and who's here. When the main-thread
  panel is open the Shelf recenters in the canvas the panel leaves visible.
- **Who's here, and who wants you**: a facepile in the top right holds
  everyone on the canvas — live people and agents in their identity color,
  plus anyone who left an unread comment behind, dimmed. A face badged with a
  count takes you to that comment; a live face takes you to their cursor.
- **Public canvases**: an owner can separately advertise an existing Canvas
  Viewer or Presentation Viewer link with **Public on this home** in Share.
  The home's Public catalogue lists titles and viewing access without loading
  previews or adding canvases to your Inbox. Browse it without signing in at
  `/public`, or use `isocan canvas list --public --home <url>`.
  `isocan share --public on|off` controls publication; unlisting keeps the link
  working, while replacing or disabling the link clears publication.
- **Sharing**: **Share** sits beside the facepile, because the pile is *who's
  here* and Share is *who may be here*. It hands you the canvas's address with
  a copy button — that is the whole invitation, and it carries no installation
  instructions on purpose: whoever receives it lands on the populated canvas in
  a browser with nothing installed, and the canvas offers a terminal to anyone
  who reaches for one. Underneath is one revocable row: **"anyone with the
  link"** is a grant the canvas is born with. Turning it off turns the next
  stranger away **and expels the ones who got in on it** — and it tells you how
  many, because the other half of that gesture is the half nobody expects:
  anyone another grant still covers stays where they are, so turning off the
  link does not throw out the people who were invited by name. `isocan share`,
  `isocan share --link off|on` is the same endpoint from a terminal — sharing
  is the one gesture that is not a canvas op, because it acts on who may knock
  rather than on what is on the canvas, so it never appears in the oplog and
  `undo` will not take it back. A canvas that will not have you says so:
  `403 not-admitted`, which means ask whoever shared it — not "get a new
  credential". Beside the toggle is **one field for one person**: invite an
  email address, and whoever proves that address is let in whether or not the
  link is on. `isocan share <email>` and `isocan share --revoke <email>` are the
  same two gestures from a terminal. Removing somebody is not the same as
  keeping them out: if the link is on they can come straight back as a
  stranger, and both surfaces say so before offering **and keep them out** —
  a **bar**, a row that says no whatever the link or any invitation says,
  listed as **kept out** with who and when, and lifted with **Let back in**
  (`--revoke <email> --bar`, `--bar <email>`, `--unbar <email>` from a
  terminal). The creator cannot be barred. Every one of these is an **owner's**:
  whoever made the canvas, or anybody invited as **Owner** — an invited
  person's rung is a picker on their row, and raising it reaches the tab they
  have open without a reload. Everyone else sees the controls disabled with
  the owner's name, and the daemon refuses them with `403 not-owner`.
- **Spaces**: a named set of canvases access is set on once. **New space** on
  the canvas list makes one; the list draws a heading per space and **No
  space** last, and a card's **Move to space…** (or dragging it onto a
  heading) puts a canvas in — at most one space per canvas. The space's
  **Share**, from its heading, is the canvas's Share one scope wider, with one
  more row at the top: **Every canvas in this space**, which sets or turns
  off the link on each canvas in one gesture and says how many it reached.
  A person's rung on a canvas is the highest from any row on the canvas or
  on its space — the space's rows are a floor, never a ceiling, so one canvas
  in a locked space can still be opened to a client. A canvas's Share shows
  the space's rows first, greyed, as *from the space*. `isocan space
  new|list|add|remove|delete` and `isocan share --space <name>` are the same
  routes from a terminal, and `isocan canvas list` groups by space.
  Choose **Space** while creating a canvas, or use `isocan canvas create
  "Acme board" --space Design`, to inherit the space's access from birth with
  no link grant. A space owner can create there; refusal keeps the form's
  title and chosen space. Hosted lists show admissions and named invitations,
  while a link-only canvas is reached by its shared address.
- **Groups**: a named set of people access is given to once. **Groups…** on
  the canvas list makes one and edits who is in it; the Share dialog's invite
  field takes a group from a picker or as `group:<name>`, and a group row
  reads by its name and size. Who is in the group is read at the door, never
  copied onto a row, so removing somebody from the group reaches every canvas
  the group is shared with in one write — their agents with them — and adding
  somebody raises them in the tab they have open. Only the group's maker sees
  its members. `isocan group new|list|add|remove|delete` and `isocan share
  group:<name>` are the same routes from a terminal.
- **Proving an address, which is not a login**: isocan has no accounts and does
  not want any. What a person can do is **borrow an attester they already
  have** — click your own face, pick **"Prove your address…"**, and a link
  arrives in the inbox; opening it writes one line onto the badge this browser
  already carries. Nothing is created: no user record, no password, nothing to
  reset, and a person who never does it keeps using isocan exactly as before.
  What it buys is two things. Somebody can invite **you** by name instead of
  handing out the link — that is what an `email:` grant is satisfied by — and a
  second surface that proves the same address may **resume the person your
  first one already is**, which is how a phone becomes you without anybody
  asserting anything. A home that has borrowed no attester says so and offers
  no control, because the link is how sharing works there; whether a home has
  one is configuration, so the same build runs on a laptop and at isocan.io.
- **Escalation**: a thin guest goes thick in one command, and the canvas hands
  it to you — click your own face and pick **"Bring your own agent…"**: one
  sentence of concept, one line, a copy button, and a clock, because the
  thing it hands you is single-use and dies in fifteen minutes. What you paste
  it into is the agent you already have running, not a shell — the line tells
  it to set the directory up and park, so the paste is the whole instruction.
  The terminal half is the same gesture with a shell's reader in mind: from a canvas you are
  already on, `isocan pass` mints a short-lived, single-use **pass** and prints
  the whole line to paste on the other machine —
  `npx github:dglazkov/isocan#release setup <address>#<pass>` — and that one
  line joins **that canvas**: the daemon opens a link to that home, redeems the
  pass so the machine is admitted and knows whose it is, writes the marker and
  the canvas's row, and replicates it. Nothing else on the machine moves —
  canvases already here stay where they are, and the birth default is set only
  if none was, which setup says out loud.
  Your own second machine arrives **as you**: an identity is handed over by a
  session that already is you, never claimed at a door. `--admit-only` mints
  the other honest shape, for an agent that will name itself. A pass is a
  credential, not an invitation — it admits even when the link grant is off, so
  it is worth exactly one machine, once, for fifteen minutes, and the address
  from `isocan share` stays the thing you hand a person. `isocan open` uses the
  same mechanism the other way: the browser it spawns arrives already being
  you, while the address it prints carries no pass. The credential rides in a
  `#fragment`, which never leaves the browser — not into the home's access log,
  not into a `Referer` — and a tab that arrives on one comes up already being
  that person, or says in words which of "expired", "already used" and "no such
  pass" it met.
- **Direct machines**: a workspace that will be thrown away does not want a
  replica in it. `isocan setup <address> --direct` — or `ISOCAN_DIRECT=1` in a
  workflow file, which reads the address out of the committed marker — sets a
  machine up with **no daemon at all**: every command speaks to the home
  itself, nothing is copied to disk, and a torn-down sandbox loses nothing
  because its whole state was always the home's. `serve`, `restart` and `stop`
  refuse there rather than quietly giving the machine a second replica, and
  `isocan direct` shows which way a machine works, sets it, or undoes it. It is
  always declared and never guessed — no environment is sniffed and no vendor
  is named, because whether a directory is worth a replica is something only
  the person setting it up knows.
- **Your surfaces**: a canvas you can reach from four machines is four
  credentials, and one of them can go missing. Click your own face and pick
  **"Your surfaces…"** — every holder that carries your identity, what each
  speaks as, how many canvases it is in, and when it was last seen, with the
  one you are reading this on marked. Ending one stops it speaking as you
  anywhere, immediately, and takes with it anything that machine had passed
  onto a canvas. `isocan badges` and `isocan badges --kill <id>` are the same
  two gestures from a terminal, and on a laptop they act on the ledger of the
  **home your canvases are born at**, because that is the one that stops a
  machine you no longer have.
  Ending a surface is not the same as un-inviting it: it comes back as a
  stranger with none of your personas, and whether a stranger gets in is what
  the link grant decides. The two gestures compose, and neither pretends to be
  the other.
- **Your bench**: a standing agent belongs to a canvas; the agents *you have*
  belong to you. Click your own face and pick **"Your bench…"**, or run
  `isocan bench`, for a row per agent — its name, its harness, where it stands,
  and **whether anything could answer for it right now**. That last column is
  measured every time you look and has three answers, never two: *ready*,
  *elsewhere* (it stands somewhere, but nothing is parked — a summons lands in
  silence), and *unreachable* (nothing present can run it at all). The bench
  itself is your own private canvas, so it follows you between machines instead
  of dying with the laptop it was made on. `isocan bench add <name>` takes the
  agent from what this machine already knows and `isocan bench rm <name>` takes
  it off — and a row confers nothing either way: it does not enrol an agent,
  and removing it withdraws nothing.
- **The bench fills itself**: enrolling an agent anywhere — `isocan agent add`,
  `isocan rc add`, or Add from the agents panel — writes that agent's row, so
  the registry stays true without being curated. The write is best-effort by
  design, because the registry must never be able to break the act it records:
  it never creates your personal canvas behind your back, it is never retried,
  and an enrolment cannot fail because a row could not be written. Withdrawal
  goes the other way and touches nothing — the bench is the agents you *have*,
  not the agents standing somewhere, so an agent withdrawn from every canvas
  keeps its row and reads *unreachable*, which is honest rather than tidy.
- **Bringing an agent along**: the agents panel lists your bench above *Add an
  agent…*, each row with **Join**, and `isocan bench join <name>` is the same
  act from a terminal. It enrols an agent you already have on *this* canvas —
  with no `isocan rc` parked there, because naming an agent whose actor exists
  is not the same act as introducing a stranger, and bringing one to its fifth
  canvas should not be as hard as bringing it to its first. Joining grants
  standing here and nothing else: it starts no turn, widens nobody's right to
  summon, and touches no other canvas. Each row says whether anything could
  answer *before* you click, in the same three words the bench uses.
- **Asking in the Chat**: type `@Name join` on a line of its own and the agent
  joins — the same act, said where you were already talking. Your bench is in
  the `@` menu as well as the canvas's own people, marked *not here yet* so a
  name never reads as somebody who can already hear you, and the line becomes
  a chip as you write it. When it lands the thread gets one line saying so,
  because the canvas is the only channel. A name that is not on **your** bench
  is refused with *"Name is not on your bench"* — never "unknown name", and
  never a different answer for a name that happens to exist on somebody
  else's bench, because a bench is a private canvas and a refusal that varied
  would be a way to read it one name at a time.
- **Pets follow you**: tick **Follows me** on an agent's bench row, or run
  `isocan bench follow <name>`, and it comes along to every canvas you open
  and can edit — the app sends the same invite **Join** sends, once per
  arrival, and the thread says *Scout came with Dion*. Not onto a canvas you
  can only read, and never back onto one where somebody removed it: a removal
  is the room's word. It arrives answering only you, as any joined agent
  does. `--off` (or the same tick) stops it, and where it already stands it
  stays — turning a pet off is not sending it away.
- **Cleaning up the Chat**: the canvas's owner can take any message out of
  it — a ✕ on the message — or many at once from the ⋯ in the Chat's header:
  every ⚙ isocan notice, everything one person or agent said, everything
  before a day, or the lot. Each asks with the count first, is one act, and
  offers Undo, which puts every message back where it stood.
  `isocan comment clean --system | --from <actor> | --before <date> | --all
  [--dry-run]` is the same act from a terminal, and `isocan comment rm
  <thread> <comment>` removes one. Anybody may remove their own messages;
  only the owner may remove somebody else's, and the home refuses the rest.
  Removed means out of the Chat, not out of history: the log keeps the words,
  and `history`, `at` and `export` still show them.
- **Watching one thing**: `isocan wait` is the agent's feedback loop, and it
  can be told what to care about — `--item <ref>` and `--op item.addVersion`
  (or a family, `item.*`) narrow which changes wake it, so a watcher does not
  spend a turn deciding it did not care. A summons comes through any filter,
  because an agent you cannot reach is worse than one that wakes too often, and
  an agent's own ops never wake it — so writing the thing it was watching for
  does not start it again.
- **On call**: a session belongs to one canvas, but `isocan wait` belongs to
  the *home*. A parked agent wears a dashed ring in **every** canvas's
  facepile — including one created after it started waiting — and the `@`
  picker offers it there. So a brand-new space is never empty: @-mention the
  agent, or just write in its main thread, and `wait` wakes, names the canvas
  that summoned it, and hands back a `--canvas` command that lands there.
- **What is addressed to you**: `isocan inbox` lists every comment addressed to
  you across discoverable canvases at your homes — named by somebody, in the Chat, or in
  a thread you are already part of — newest first, with the command to reply to
  each. It is the same rule `isocan wait` parks on, one function in core, so a
  parked agent and the list can never disagree about what is for you.
  `--mentions` narrows it to where somebody actually named you. The home
  screen and the in-app Inbox use the same answer, with links to each
  conversation and visible unavailable homes. The visible page refreshes
  slowly; reading the list never marks a canvas visited. The switcher works
  from home, lens and canvas, with Recent followed by space headings.
- **What is NEW, on every machine you work from** (#147, #134): a **seen-mark**
  — one row per person per canvas, the oplog head you had in front of you and
  when — kept by the home rather than by a browser. `isocan inbox --new` shows
  what arrived since; `isocan seen` lists the canvases you have been on, most
  recent first, saying which have moved since; `isocan seen --mark` says you
  have read one, and opening a canvas in the app does the same. A mark never
  goes backwards and two machines racing converge. It is **not** a read
  receipt: nobody else can see your marks, there is no route that returns
  somebody else's, and being seen is not the canvas's business — which is why
  a mark is not an operation and is not in the canvas's history.
- **New comments announce themselves**: one arriving raises a toast naming who
  wrote it; clicking it flies to the pin. Until you read it the pin wears an
  unread badge, its author's face is badged in the pile, and the tab title
  carries the count. Which THREADS you have read is per viewer, kept in the
  browser — so reopening a canvas shows what happened while you were away.
- **Two parties, two names**: the person who owns the machine, and the agents
  working on it. `~/.isocan/identity.json` is yours; an agent claims an actor
  against the session id its harness exports (`isocan identity --session` —
  naming yourself is an operation, applied atomically by the daemon, which
  hands out a free name when none is asked for), so two agents sharing a
  directory stay two people. An agent introducing itself can never rename
  you, and a CLI with no terminal and no session gets an error rather than a
  slot — because the thing at the other end of a pipe is not the person.
  (`isocan setup` sidesteps the question entirely: it makes no canvas, so
  none is stamped with whoever typed it.)
- **Identity**: a name you pick at the door (web dialog / CLI prompt); stamped
  on every mutation, comment, and version. Click your own face in the pile to
  change it: *rename* keeps your actor id, so your undo stack and the comments
  addressed to you stay yours (`isocan identity --name` does the same); *leave*
  returns you to the door, which now offers every name this browser has worn —
  coming back as one resumes that same actor, not a stranger sharing a name.
  A rename re-labels your face on everyone else's screen on the next presence
  beat, without dropping the socket — in the terminal too: `isocan identity
  --name` pushes the new name to your live cursor at once, and every command
  that narrates re-states who is holding the session. Architected so
  authenticated identity
  later only changes how an `Actor` is minted. Agents pick a name of their
  own — one hiding in the letters of "isocan" (Isaac, Kenny, Nico, …), not
  their vendor's — checking `isocan who --all` first so no two collaborators
  answer to the same `@Name`.
- **Trash & undo**: deletes go to a per-canvas trash; undo is
  **actor-scoped** (`⌘Z`/`⇧⌘Z`, `isocan undo|redo`) — your undo walks your
  own ops, never a collaborator's. Entries invalidated by others (your target
  got deleted) are skipped; batch inverses shrink to their surviving members.
  Trash-empty and canvas-delete are confirmation-gated and not undoable.
- **Offline, in the browser**: a tab that loses its network keeps working. A
  service worker caches the app shell, the canvas and its seq cursor live in
  IndexedDB — so a reload with no network comes back to the canvas, not to a
  blank page — and changes made meanwhile are applied at once and queued. On
  reconnect the queue goes up FIRST and is ordered by the home; only then is
  the socket dialled with the cursor, so the tail that comes down already
  contains your work in the home's order. A bar says how many changes are
  being held; anything the home refuses is rolled back **and said out loud**,
  never silently. Every write carries a client-minted op id, so retrying one
  whose answer was lost is answered with the entry it already became rather
  than a duplicate-id refusal. Two things deliberately do not work offline
  and say so: adding a **file** (bytes are not queued) and **undo** (the
  stack is the home's, walked over the whole oplog).
- **Talk to the canvas** (experiment, `modules.talk`): a floating mic that opens
  a Gemini Live session from the browser with **your own key** — stored in that
  browser only, never on the canvas or the daemon. Spoken requests become the
  same operations a click sends, wearing your identity and undo; the captions
  and level bars float by the button and disappear with the turn. ⌘K →
  "Configure voice" is the settings door; `isocan voice` says where the button is.
- **Canvases**: a canvas is the unit of work; create/list/edit/delete from
  either surface.
- **A directory is its canvas** (#60): `<dir>/.isocan/project.json` binds a
  directory (git toplevel when in a repo) to a canvas — identity only, the
  state stays in `~/.isocan`. Written automatically when an agent names
  itself (`identity --session` creates the canvas if needed, named after
  the directory), or by hand with `isocan use <canvas>`. Resolution walks
  up like `.git`; a committed marker means a clone knows which canvas it
  is. A marker this machine has never seen that names **no** home is
  materialized under its own id on the first addition; one that names a home
  this machine has never dialled is **fetched from there** — the daemon opens
  a link, that home's door decides, and the row is written, with nothing else
  on the machine moving. In a bound directory `canvas list` narrows to
  that canvas (`--all` widens) and `wait` listens to it alone — there is no
  home-wide listening; the old "on call" presence was retired with this
  change. `~/.isocan/dirs.json` is the dir→canvas roster, a lazily healed
  cache.
- **Backups**: `isocan export` writes a canvas to a directory — the whole
  log verbatim, every blob it names, the folded snapshot, a manifest — in
  the same layout `~/.isocan` keeps, so the directory IS the canvas with no
  daemon involved. Point it at this directory's canvas, at a canvas or one
  item by URL (any home you may see), or at a whole home; `--git <repo>`
  commits and pushes it. `isocan import <dir>` hands it back to a home
  through the route teleport arrives by — same seqs, same timestamps,
  creates and never merges. [`docs/isocan-export.md`](docs/isocan-export.md).

Items and threads resolve by id, id prefix, or title prefix. `--json`
everywhere for scripting.

For optional Tailwind v4 repository checks, run this standalone script from an
isocan source checkout:

```sh
node scripts/design-lint-repo.mjs --repo /path/to/project --json -- src/example.tsx
```

It uses the target repository's existing ESLint configuration and dependencies,
without installing packages or applying fixes. Reports are advisory and expose
incomplete coverage; zero findings does not establish design-policy compliance.
The [optional-tool research](docs/research/2026-09-14-optional-project-linters.md)
records compatibility proofs, limits and recommendations for other technologies.

The source checkout also includes a repair-evaluation dry run. Choose a fresh
output directory:

```sh
node scripts/design-lint-eval.mjs --dry-run --out /tmp/acme-design-eval
```

It exercises six fixtures in 36 canned runs through a real local daemon, Chrome
and conditional repair, with zero evaluation model calls. It proves the harness;
it does not infer model lift or human ratings. Model mode requires a separately
user-approved budget. See the [evaluation plan](docs/projects/design-lint/evaluation.md)
and [measured results](docs/research/2026-09-14-design-lint-evaluation.md).
For the documented pilot's verified zero-token login refusal, model mode also
accepts `--continue-from <prior-output-directory>` with a fresh `--out`. It
retains the original budget and used invocation count and claims one successor;
its narrow eligibility rules are part of the evaluation plan.


## Architecture

npm-workspaces monorepo, source-mode TypeScript (tsx + Vite consume `.ts`
directly). A checkout builds two things and an install runs a third: the web
bundle, the API's declarations, and — since 18 Sep 2026 — the CLI itself.
**What you install is a bundle.** `npm i -g github:dglazkov/isocan#release`
links `packages/cli/dist/isocan.mjs`, built by `scripts/release.mjs`, so a
command starts without tsx and without opening 297 source files; a checkout
still runs `packages/cli/bin/isocan.js` through tsx and is unchanged. The
argument, and what it cost an agent in a small sandbox, is
`docs/projects/first-minute/`.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `packages/core` | The contract: state model, operation vocabulary, pure reducer, inverse engine, placement math |
| `packages/server` | The daemon: Fastify + WS, single-writer op pipeline, fsynced oplog, snapshots, content-addressed blobs, undo stacks |
| `packages/cli` | `isocan` — commander CLI mapping 1:1 to operations, daemon auto-spawn |
| `packages/web` | React + zustand canvas in the "Drafting Table" design; WS replica applying the shared reducer |

**The logged-out surface is a route, not a site.** A browser that is nobody yet
and asks for `/` gets a front page — the idea in two sentences, the three steps
that get you onto a canvas with the install line ready to copy, one screenshot
of a real canvas with four cursors on it, and the ledger that is the whole
argument: a gesture on the left, the command that performs the identical
operation on the right. `/public` is also identity-independent and shows only
explicitly listed entry metadata. Canvas entry keeps its existing door: a
presentation can open anonymously, while reading the canvas asks for a name.
This used to be a separate static site under `marketing/`,
which nothing served and which drifted from the app the day it was written; it
was folded into `packages/web` and the directory deleted, because two front
doors is one too many.

Storage lives under `~/.isocan` (override with `ISOCAN_HOME`): per-canvas
directories with human-readable JSON snapshots, an append-only `oplog.jsonl`
as the source of truth (crash recovery replays the tail), and sha256
content-addressed blobs. Every op's inverse is computed from pre-state and
stored in the log — undo/redo replay stored inverses, never re-derive them.

Storage is reclaimed by `isocan gc` (or the trash panel's "Reclaim storage"):
it compacts the oplog to an undo horizon (default: the last 500 ops, kept
pair-complete so redo never dangles; dropped entries go to
`oplog-archive.jsonl`, which `tail --archived` and `recap` still read —
compacted history is archived, never lost to the product), then sweeps blobs
unreachable from live items, the
trash, and the retained log. Blobs younger than ten minutes are never swept,
covering the gap between upload and `item.add`.

Version stacks are kept whole by default — every `edit` is history. What a
generator republishes on every commit is not: `isocan version prune <item>
--keep N --force` (or `gc --keep-versions N --force` for every item) keeps the
newest N and the current one, logged as `item.pruneVersions` so replicas
forget the same versions, and the next `gc` sweeps their bytes. Measured on a
14-panel board with 837 versions: the snapshot every load and every CLI
command carries is ~220 KB of version metadata against ~90 KB of content;
the render itself only ever fetches the current version, so the cost of a
deep stack is the snapshot and the storage, not the screens.

The daemon also does this to itself: every canvas it holds, a minute after it
starts serving and every hour after that (`ISOCAN_GC_INTERVAL_MS`), so a home
that runs for months does not need anybody to remember — and one that is only
alive in short bursts still collects, which is why the first sweep is a minute
out rather than an hour. Nothing schedules it from outside: a home collects its
own garbage, which is why there is no credential anywhere in this story.

## Answering to a home

**The home is a property of the canvas, not of the machine.** One daemon is
the **home** of some canvases — it holds them, serves their pages, and is the
single writer of everything on them — and a **replica** for others: it still
answers your CLI instantly from a local copy, but their writes travel to the
home that holds them and come back, and their pages are served there. Which is
which is decided per canvas, by two things that must agree: the
`.isocan/project.json` marker, which carries the address a canvas was born at
and travels with a clone, and `~/.isocan/homes.json`, this machine's own row
per canvas written when it is born or joined and never guessed. A canvas with
no row is one this daemon is the home of. When the two disagree, the command is
refused with both addresses named — moving a canvas between homes is a
deliberate act, never something a stray command does on your behalf.

That is the one-origin rule, and it was always per canvas: every canvas has
exactly one door, so its cookie, its service worker and its browser replica
live in one origin's storage. So a daemon serves the app for the canvases it is
the home of and, for the rest, answers a page request by naming the home that
does. A laptop can hold local work and a team's work at once without either
canvas getting two doors.

As a replica it carries **the canvases it was let into**, not everything at
that home: one you joined with a pass (`isocan setup <address>#<pass>`), one
born in a directory here, one named by a `.isocan/project.json` that came with
a clone. So a fresh replica starts empty on purpose, and a canvas at the home
that is not on this machine is not missing — nobody has handed it over.

```sh
isocan home                       # where each canvas here lives, and whether
                                  # each of those homes is answering
isocan home https://isocan.io     # canvases born here are born there
isocan home --clear               # canvases born here stay here
```

`isocan home` with no argument reports per canvas, because that is where the
answer lives:

```
role             home of 2 canvases; replica of https://isocan.io (1); new canvases → https://isocan.io
birth default    https://isocan.io — a canvas born here is born there; nothing already here moved
answering        yes — https://isocan.io is up

canvases
CANVAS           ID        HOME
Acme Sprint      prj_7f3a  here — this daemon is its home
Test Fixture     prj_91b2  here — this daemon is its home
Widget Redesign  prj_c40d  https://isocan.io
```

`isocan home <url>` sets the **birth default** — where a canvas born here from
now on is born — and **nothing already here moves**: canvases already at a home
still answer to it, canvases already local stay local, and `--clear` says the
same in the mirror. It writes `~/.isocan/config.json` and restarts the daemon,
because a daemon reads that file once, at boot; it checks the address answers
first, since a canvas whose home cannot be reached refuses every write and
queues nothing (`--force` sets it anyway). `ISOCAN_HOME_URL` overrides the file
and means the same narrow thing. There is **no default address** — `isocan
serve` with nothing configured births locally, which is what every daemon in
this repo does.

`isocan serve` on a rented VM is a complete home: the same daemon, the same
code, reachable by anyone you point at it.

## Updating

```sh
isocan upgrade      # fetch the newest build, then restart the daemon on it
isocan restart      # just restart: run the build you already have
isocan status       # who holds the port, and which copy they are running
```

The daemon outlives the command that started it — `ensureDaemon` only starts
one when the port is silent — so upgrading the CLI leaves yesterday's daemon
serving yesterday's app. Every build now says which copy it is (`root`, and
when its code was written), so a CLI notices when the daemon isn't its
sibling: it says so once per daemon rather than on every command, `setup`
restarts a stale one outright, and an open tab whose bundle no longer matches
the one being served offers a reload.

`npx github:dglazkov/isocan#release …` re-resolves the branch every run, so it
always fetches the newest *release* — but it cannot replace a daemon an
earlier run left behind; `isocan restart` does. From a checkout,
`git pull && npm install`, then restart.

## Development

**New contributor?** [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) is
the first hour: clone to running, the three homes and which one you are
pointing at, how work reaches production, and the house practices that are not
obvious from the code.

[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) is what actually runs and
where; the [\[isocan\] System design](https://isocan.io/p/prj_6fgykNN1_m) canvas is the same
material as instruments you can drive, and the better first sitting.

[`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) is the whole of it, written for the
people who actually work here: an **upgrade** door for a rig built before
the home work landed, and a **first entry** door — `git clone` to a running dev
setup to a canvas of your own at dev.isocan.io — plus the shared matter, the
clean-shell discipline and the hazards. What follows is the command list it
expands on.

```sh
npm run dev         # daemon + Vite with hot reload
npm run dev:replica # a scratch machine on :4442 with its OWN isocan home —
                    # `-- <command>` runs any CLI command against it. It starts
                    # from empty on purpose, badge included, so join a canvas
                    # with `-- setup <address>#<pass>` and exercise that path
                    # from zero
npm test            # vitest: reducer round-trips, random-walk undo property
                    # tests, storage crash recovery, daemon HTTP/WS integration.
                    # The fast lane — it leaves out the files that spawn the
                    # CLI per case and says so at the end
npm run test:deep   # those too: ~4 minutes, and what every flake has lived in
npm run test:ci     # the gate CI applies: deep, plus the emulator and the
                    # bundle budget, with no suite allowed to skip itself
npm run typecheck   # strict tsc across all packages
npm run release     # build, commit onto the `release` branch, push it
```

Work happens on `main`; `release` is generated, and generating it is CI's job:
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) tests,
typechecks and releases every commit pushed to `main`, so what people install
is never older than what landed. A red test leaves the last good release
standing until the next green commit.

`npm run release` is the same thing by hand, for when you want one now: it
refuses a dirty tree or an unpushed HEAD, builds the web app, and commits that
build alongside this tree under a manifest with no `prepare` and no
`workspaces` (`-- --no-push` to stop before the push). Each release commit has
two parents — the previous release, and the `main` commit it was built from —
so the branch never needs a force push and `git log release` answers "which
build is this?".

Agents working in this repo start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). What teaches
one to collaborate on a canvas is `isocan --agent-help`: the protocol —
naming yourself, appearing, the comment→build→reply→`wait` lap, every verb on
one line — with the rest behind `isocan --agent-help <topic>`, shipped inside
the CLI (`packages/cli/src/agent-guide.md`), so it always describes
the build in hand rather than whatever was installed months ago (#75). The
[Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/specification) at
`.agents/skills/isocan-collab/` — the location most harnesses discover on
their own; Claude Code reaches the same file through the committed symlink at
`.claude/skills/isocan-collab` — is the doorway that points there. Adding a
harness means adding a doorway to that file, never a second copy of it
(`test/skills.test.ts` holds the line).

### Opt-in sandbox for summoned Codex agents

`isocan rc --codex-sandbox` (also `rc turn <agent> <prompt> --codex-sandbox`)
uses Codex's native workspace sandbox on macOS and Linux. It requires
codex-acp 1.11 or newer. Workspace and isocan-state writes are allowed;
permission escalation is refused. Git metadata remains protected, so reads
and diffs work but committing does not. This bounds Codex's tools, not the
adapter process, file reads, or separately configured MCP services.

`codexSandbox: true` in `~/.isocan/config.json` makes this the standing choice;
`--unsandboxed` overrides it for a run. `codexSandboxDomains` adds exact network
hostnames, for example `["github.com", "registry.npmjs.org"]`. The daemon's host
is included automatically and existing Codex domain rules still compose.
See the [measured network boundary](docs/research/2026-09-10-what-the-rc-hands-over.md#native-codex-opt-in--11-september)
before choosing it. The separate `--sandbox` flag fences the entire adapter
with srt; combining the two is refused until nesting has been validated.

### Whose word starts a summoned turn

A summoned turn runs on the machine of the person whose `isocan rc` answers
for the agent, and spends that person's tokens — so a standing agent answers
**only its owner** (that machine's person, and anything the machine itself
speaks as) until the owner widens it. A mention from anybody else starts
nothing and counts against nothing; isocan answers it in the thread with
whose word the agent takes — and **that refusal is the control**: under it,
for the owner and nobody else, are *Let \<them\> ask* and *Let anyone ask*.
*Who can ask* on the agent's row opens everyone here as checkboxes, a grant
can be given until tonight or for seven days (it lapses, and the agent says
that is what happened), and `isocan rc listen <name> --to <names>|everyone
[--until 7d]` is the same act in a terminal.
The rc announces its policy with its hold, so the tray and `isocan who` say
*listens only to Nico* before anybody asks, and the add-agent dialog is
offered to the rc's owner alone. Only the owner's word widens: a gate
somebody else wrote into the enrolment is set aside, and said.

**You see an agent arrive.** When an agent shows up on the canvas you are
looking at — an `isocan rc` starts answering for it, or its session appears —
a small note drops in under the presence pile, top right: *"Percy joined ·
listens only to you (Nico)"*, or *"Percy is back"* after more than five
minutes away, and fades after about twelve seconds — it stays while you point at it. It is read from the presence
the page already has; nothing is written. Agents only, never yourself, and
never for whoever was already here when you opened the canvas. A flapping
connection says nothing.

If you want it in the Chat as well, as history, `isocan rc --announce` (or
`rcAnnounce` in `~/.isocan/config.json`: `true`, or a list of agent names and
canvas ids) has the agent post one line in its own name — *"Percy is here —
answering a mention or the Chat; listens only to Nico."*, *is back* after
five minutes away, *stepped away* on a deliberate stop. Off by default. The
lines are records, so they summon nobody, and no agent answers another's
hello.

### Jetski plugin and model-pinned agents

[`plugins/jetski/`](plugins/jetski/) is isocan as a Jetski plugin: the canvas
your workspace is bound to, in a pane beside the Jetski chat. Every part of it
is an `isocan` command, so the plugin can do nothing the CLI cannot. The
`#release` install carries it alongside the CLI: `isocan setup --jetski` (or
`node scripts/install-jetski-plugin.mjs` in a checkout) links it into
`~/.gemini/config/plugins/isocan`. Restart Jetski after installing: it reads
a plugin's hooks once, when the plugin loads.

- **A canvas without its own Chat (`isocan embed`)**: the embed address opens
  with `?embed=1`, which means no Chat dock and no way in to one (⌘J, the rail,
  the palette and the menus are all closed). The conversation beside it is
  where you talk. Presence, comments and the rest of the canvas stay.
  `isocan embed --chat` keeps the Chat. A framed canvas tells its parent it is
  ready. Once the parent answers, it tells that one origin what is selected,
  and that is how the pane sees your selection.
- **The pane** (`sidecars/canvas/`) opens the canvas that the workspace's
  `.isocan/project.json` names. An unbound folder can be bound to an existing
  canvas (by id, link or title) or to a new one. Selected items show as chips,
  and **Ask** hands your question, with the item ids, to the Jetski
  conversation. **Open ↗** opens the same canvas in a tab, with its Chat.
- **Skills on both sides**: type `/` in the pane's box and the canvas's own
  skills drop down (`isocan command ls`, built in and added with `/skill
  add`). Run one in this conversation, which gets `/name args` and is told
  `isocan command show <name>` holds its instructions, or hand it to a
  standing agent as a comment (`/design-audit @Orla …`). Starters under the
  box change with the selection and show what you can do: *Build this in the
  repo*, *Put what we did here on the canvas*, the design skills, and *Answer
  N open questions*.
- **The canvas can reach the conversation**: while the pane runs, a mention
  of a Jetski conversation on the canvas (or a reply in its thread) is
  relayed into that conversation, which answers on the canvas.
  `ISOCAN_JETSKI_RELAY=off` turns this off. **Asks N** in the header lists
  the questions agents left for you. **Fan out** asks Jetski's `flash`,
  `pro` or `flash_lite` tiers the same thing in new conversations that join
  the canvas under their own names. 💬 beside a face opens that conversation.
- **Arriving**: a SessionStart hook runs when a conversation starts in a
  bound workspace. It names the conversation (`isocan identity --session`,
  keyed to that conversation) and starts its session, so what it writes is
  attributed to it rather than to you. With `ISOCAN_JETSKI_JOIN=off` the
  conversation still gets the note, but nothing joins.
- **Model-pinned agents (`--model <id>`)**: `isocan agent add`,
  `isocan rc add` and `isocan bench add` take a model id, spelled the way its
  harness spells it. The id always rides `ISOCAN_MODEL`. It reaches the
  harness itself only through a door that harness really has:
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` for Claude Code, `model` in Codex's `CODEX_CONFIG`, or
  `{model}` in an `acpAdapters` declaration. `isocan harness` shows
  `model: pins` or `model: own` for each harness, so you know which agents
  are really pinned before you compare them. The pane's **Agents** bar enrols
  the presets in `sidecars/canvas/presets.json`, with buttons like
  *+ Orla · Opus 5.5*. Each agent has a name of its own, never its model's.
  They answer @mentions while your `isocan rc` runs.

A canvas on this machine's own daemon (`http://127.0.0.1:…`) can only be
framed by a browser on this machine. To use Jetski Web from anywhere else,
bind the folder to a canvas on a shared home such as isocan.io.
